This device will not carrier provided IMEI compatibility checks due to incomplete records. AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile customers: Simply place your active Sim card into the device to begin connecting to the network. MVNO customers(Metro, Mint, Ultra, Xfinity, Straight Talk, Spectrum, Cricket, etc.): You will need to "activate" your IMEI with a representative over a phone call(Automated methods will not work). Initially, they will tell you the device is not compatible. You will need to ask them to record the IMEI number anyway. Once that is complete, you will need to ensure you place the sim card into the corresponding slot. IMEI 1 is assigned to sim card slot 1. IMEI 2 is assigned to sim card slot 2. If all prior steps have been properly completed, your phone should begin to operate as expected after a few minutes.',
