This device will not carrier provided IMEI compatibility checks due to incomplete records. AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile customers: Simply place your active Sim card into the device to begin connecting to the network. MVNO customers(Metro, Mint, Ultra, Xfinity, Straight Talk, Spectrum, Cricket, etc.): You will need to \"activate\" your IMEI with a representative over a phone call(Automated methods will not work). Initially, they will tell you the device is not compatible. You will need to ask them to record the IMEI number anyway. Once that is complete, you will need to ensure you place the sim card into the corresponding slot. IMEI 1 is assigned to sim card slot 1. IMEI 2 is assigned to sim card slot 2. If all prior steps have been properly completed, your phone should begin to operate as expected after a few minutes.",

      "reviewDescription": "Been experimenting with this camera for a bit now and wow this is one mighty little device! The image quality is way better than I was imagining it to be, the 4k resolution really helps highlight every detail and makes every photo super clear. When first setting it up, it was really easy to understand the settings, and I am by no means a tech person.  Not only is it incredibly easy to use but it's also super light weight and easy to hold. Also, the battery life lasts a good 2-3 hours which is nice if you only want to take a few pics here and there. If you're someone planning on taking multiple pics throughout the day, I recommend having the second battery it comes with along side you as well. As for someone who is new to the camera world, i would highly recommend this one. It's perfect for beginners or anyone just wanting a little camera or even for those that want lots of high quality pics in the 4k footage! For this price, the quality is unbeatable! Clear winner for me!",

      "reviewDescription": "Great health and fitness tracker overall! Tracks much better than my old Pixel watch, and I appreciate that it prioritizes battery life over a display -- hoping v5 will be even more compact!The app is really good, although I guess it has to be since the device has no display. I wear mine daily and have no issues with durability after about 10 months of use.I would recommend a bicep band or something else to give your wrist a break. I have their compression shorts as well, which are surprisingly nice (and they have good discounts around turkey time).The band it ships with is nice, but does get funky after a while. I stopped wearing mine in the shower, which helped, but I'd also consider get a second band to switch things up.Lastly, HSA! I originally had a trial with Whoop, but ended up buying on Amazon to use my HSA card to pay for it. You can do the same on Whoop's site, but you'll have to reimburse yourself -- so super nice to be able to use your card on Amazon.",

      "reviewTitle": "Hot Garbage",
      "reviewDescription": "** update March 9. I completed a 5.1 mile hike with an average pace of 3.5 mph. What does the whoop say?  271 calories.  If you look at the internet. For my weight and that pace the calorie burn is between 550 and 620 kcal. But whoop, whoop says 271. I have never used a more inaccurate unreliable piece of trash.**update 10/19 deducting yet another star.  The device is basically worthless.  Sad because it‚Äôs a good idea and is expensive. Did a 3 mile walk this morning to warm up. I‚Äôm 190# man. Walking a flat mile even at a somewhat leisurely pace costs my body 110-125Kcal.  Wearing the whoop and my Apple Watch.  Watch records 350 kcal burned. The whoop‚Ä¶123. Both set to ‚Äúwalking‚Äù  worn on opposite wrists.  123 vs 350.  The device is absolute garbage. Avoid it.** update 9/12. Deducting another starI really wanted to love this device and maybe mine is just a lemon. The readings, specifically heart rate which is one of the only things I am really truly  interested in are so far from accurate that the device is almost worthless.  This is disappointing because the device is both expensive and has an expensive subscription associated with it.  I did a hard workout again wearing both my Apple Watch and my WHOOP.  Was 30 minute EMOM. Alternating rounds of 10 double unders And 15 Russian kettlebell swings at 80#. So at least for me a metabolically demanding workout.  During the double unders Apple Watch has my heart rate pegged between 165 and 175  Which makes sense based on the activity and how I feel (like I‚Äôm sprinting).  The average for the whole Apple device was just under 150 BPM.  Conversely, the whoop worn on my other wrist Shows my heart rate during the double-unders at between 96 and 120 (Which again is moronic) And my heart rate for the overall workout at 127.  Only after I started my cool down and my heart rate dropped did the Apple Watch and the WHOOP come into line. I wonder if the WHOOP is just too imprecise as a piece of hardware so when your heart rate is extremely fast it‚Äôs missing beats, I‚Äôm just theorizing but it‚Äôs disappointing in any event.  The AI WHOOP support is also completely worthless. canned responses and useless troubleshooting pages. I don‚Äôt know what device to recommend, but if you‚Äôre serious about your data, this ain‚Äôt it**update 8/25.I wore my my Apple Watch Ultra and Whoop at the same time today (albeit Whoop on right arm Apple Watch on left) as discussed in the main review below.  I set both devices to ‚Äúfunctional strength‚Äù and then went about my work out.  Main part of the work out was 30 minutes. During that time. The whoop registered 241 cals burned and an avg heart rate of 119. The Apple registered 327 cals burned and an average heart rate of 129.  I also noticed that during certain periods of the session, the Apple registered my heart rate at 145 bpm and the Whoop 107. I‚Äôve been an athlete my whole life I know what 107 feels like, and I know what 145 feels like.  I also at that point timed my pulse and got 140.  Not sure if the whoop reflects a high degree of latency (claims it doesn‚Äôt) but that reading is way way off. Could also account for  the meaningful deviation in calories.  I pinged the whoop chat bot to ask. It was useless. Offered a lot of semi science mumbo jumbo about strain calculations.  I‚Äôm deducting another star.I work out daily. Have for the last decade and a half. When I was younger it was conditioning for various combat sports. Now that I‚Äôm in my 40s it‚Äôs conditioning for the combat sport that is life. I still get after it pretty hard every day, and in the last few years have become interested in tracking biometrics. It started with various Fitbit devices, which were super limited, moving up to the pretty good Garmin instinct solar, to The OK Apple Watch Ultra (you can find my review on here somewhere) And now the Whoop. The reason I wanted to move away from the Apple Watch is threefold (although candidly the device is deeply flawed in general). 1) It‚Äôs far too busy, too much going on, too many notifications too much buzzing 2) The battery life sucks (2.5 days max) and 3) I really like watches, actual watches, aesthetically I think the Apple Watch Ultra is just awful.  The WHOOP checks all the boxes. It has no screen or buttons, it does not buzz. It is extremely minimalist. It is very lightweight And comfortable.  Battery life is about a week, However, in a bit of pretty ingenious engineering, you don‚Äôt take it off to charge it. You charge a small battery pack That Whoop wears like a backpack on your wrist. So every few days I just slap that on after my workout the Whoop charges fully in a manner of minutes and we go about our day.  The Whoop interface is ok. Its fine. I think there‚Äôs a lot of data in there and I‚Äôm just getting used to accessing it.  I like that it‚Äôs sleep and recovery focused. Every day I get a grade for my sleep quality (usually not great) And a related grade level of ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù from yesterday. I don‚Äôt pretend to know the science behind the recovery statistics, however directionally they are in line with the way my body feels in the morning and throughout the day.  The major flaw in the WHOOP design that I have encountered so far in its ‚Äústrain‚Äù calculations. Once you wear the device for a few days It starts to make customize recommendations for how hard you should push yourself physically given your recovery level. That‚Äôs fine, Although I tend to just move through my schedule of splits and conditioning irrespective of what the Whoop says. What I have observed though, and it annoys me, is that the calorie calculations are way off relative to every other device I‚Äôve ever used. For a given activity I think they‚Äôre probably 20 to 30% low relative to the Apple and 40% low relative to the Garmin.  They‚Äôre also internally contradictory. Here is an example: today was a conditioning day. I did a pretty hard workout which consisted of timed sets of pull-ups, push-ups, and jump squats.  It‚Äôs a 30 minute timer.  You do seven pull-ups 15 push-ups and 20 squats per minute and then rest the next minute, etc.  So you wind up doing the high volume of movements.  And your heart rate is quite elevated.  My Apple Watch records this session at a bit over 400 calories. My WHOOP records it at 258 calories.  I‚Äôm not sure which is right, But I will say that the WHOOP has a ‚Äústrain‚Äù score, which is roughly a measure of how hard your body is working during the exercise.  Before the exercise ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù my score 8.2, with a heart rate averaging in the 130s with peaks in the low 160s.  When I finish the exercise and added in the movements as prompted by the WHOOP It recalculates the strain score to 16.8. Reflecting the work rate associated with the movements I was doing. So the strain increased to almost double to accommodate the amount of work done during the session. Why did the amount of calories calculated by the WHOOP not increase?  Exertion requires thermodynamic energy; my strain went up because I was doing more work, work = energy output= calories.  So that is a bit bit silly. Overall I‚Äôm still pretty happy and the actual numbers don‚Äôt matter, although little sloppy nits like this bother me.  Maybe they‚Äôll work it out in a future software release.",

      "reviewDescription": "This is an amazing product that is completely worth it. Its cordless charging is a game changer. My husband never takes it off. It‚Äôs smaller than the bigger Apple Watch and it doesn‚Äôt irritate my husband‚Äôs wrist like the Fitbit did over time. It offers so much insight to my husband‚Äôs sleep patterns and workout routine a well. Highly Recommend!",

      "reviewDescription": "This smart watch is well made. I compared the results of different features to my galaxy watch ultra. Heart beat is pretty accurate, blood oxygenation feature works well and it records sleep and tracks exercise. What I don't like much about this watch is the app. I had to install on the phone which was a little complicated to find and the pairing process was also a little complicated but it worked fine once paired. The app records your age, weight, height and keeps track of your exercise time and type of workout. The watch also reads messages and you can use for calls. In general is a good budget smartwatch.",

      "reviewTitle": "An Unforgettable 5-Star Experience!",
      "reviewDescription": "I never thought I would be writing a review for a security camera, but after my unforgettable experience with the Blink Mini, I couldn't resist sharing my story. From the moment I set my eyes on this compact indoor plug-in smart security camera, I knew my home would never be the same again.Unboxing:When the package arrived, I eagerly tore it open like a kid on Christmas morning. Inside, I found the Blink Mini, beautifully wrapped in its pristine white color. I have to admit, the camera itself looked adorable, and I couldn't help but chuckle at its tiny size. It was like a cute little spy on a mission to protect my home.Easy Setup:Setting up the Blink Mini was an absolute breeze. Even for a technologically challenged person like me, it took no more than a few minutes. I plugged it into an outlet, connected it to my Wi-Fi using the Blink app on my smartphone, and voila! I was ready to go. It's worth mentioning that the app was incredibly user-friendly, guiding me through the entire setup process with clear instructions.Crystal Clear HD Video:The Blink Mini boasts an impressive 1080p HD video quality, and boy, does it deliver! The first time I viewed the live feed on my phone, I was blown away by the clarity and sharpness of the image. It felt like I was watching a high-definition movie, except this one was starring my own living room. The camera captured every detail, from the texture of my couch to the fur on my pet's back.Night Vision Magic:Nighttime is when the real fun begins with the Blink Mini. Its advanced night vision feature turned my house into a stage for some comical shenanigans. I caught my mischievous cat, Mr. Whiskers, attempting to conquer the refrigerator at 2 a.m. The night vision mode illuminated the scene in eerie green, giving Mr. Whiskers an otherworldly glow as he tiptoed across the kitchen counter. It was like watching a feline James Bond.Motion Detection Follies:The motion detection feature of the Blink Mini had its fair share of funny moments. Every time a fly buzzed around the camera, it triggered an alert on my phone. It was hilarious watching myself rush to check the feed, only to find out it was just an insect causing all the fuss. I even started a game with my friends, betting on how many false alarms the camera would give me in a day. It was all in good fun, and it never failed to provide a good laugh.Two-Way Audio Pranks:One of my favorite features of the Blink Mini is the two-way audio. Oh, the pranks I pulled on my unsuspecting family members! I would wait until they were in the living room, then remotely activate the camera's audio. Their puzzled expressions as they tried to figure out where the voice was coming from were absolutely priceless. I must admit, I took great pleasure in pretending to be the voice of their conscience.Works with Alexa Magic:Being able to control the Blink Mini with Alexa was a game-changer. I could simply ask Alexa to show me the camera feed on my Echo Show, and in an instant, my house became a live reality show. My friends were in awe when they witnessed this magical interaction. It felt like I had just stepped into the future, where security cameras respond to my every command.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Blink Mini exceeded all my expectations. It provided top-notch security for my home while offering endless entertainment. The easy setup, exceptional video quality, night vision hilarity, motion detection follies, two-way audio pranks, and seamless integration with Alexa made it a true gem. If you're looking for a smart security camera that will keep you safe and entertained, I wholeheartedly recommend the Blink Mini. Trust me, you won't be able to wipe the smile off your face!",

      "reviewTitle": "Gets the job done",
      "reviewDescription": "I got a 2-pak of Blink Minis on sale and I am happy with my purchase. Will you be?  Read on.They work great, stand alone, as a drop-in viewport with echo show devices using voice commands, fire TV sticks using voice commands and the Blink app on the phone.  If you want more than that then factor in the cost of a subscription to the Blink cloud service because it is more than just a cloud storage service, it unlocks all of the Blink Mini features except the ability to drop-in and view a live video feed via those three methods I just mentioned.You can not use the Alexa app on your phone, tablet, etc. with the camera at all without a Blink subscription plan active. Here is what Blink says about it: Even without a Blink Subscription owners of Blink Video Doorbell, Outdoor, Indoor (gen 2), or Mini cameras receive Motion Alerts in the Blink app that you tap to enter the camera's Live View. No clips are saved. That is straight from the manufacturer's website. Heads up, adding the Sync Module 2 does not add that functionality.Considering using local storage by purchasing a Sync Module 2 to use with your Minis?  The primary function of the Sync Module 2 is as a wifi booster for the low power Blink Outdoor cams running off only battery power. The Minis do not need this since they run off AC power. The Blink Outdoor cams offload the wifi video upload for the cloud onto the Sync Module 2 because it has an ac power source and so sending the video from the Sync Module 2 instead of directly from the outdoor cams saves battery life in the cams.  Now you know the true purpose of the Sync Module 2.  No, it won't give you recording and motion detection functionality in place of a subscription. To further confuse things, if you have an active subscription, including the free trial that is automatically started when you setup your first Blink device, the module functions only as a once a day backup device and can not function as a local storage device for videos. Once your free 30 day trial subscription runs out, the Sync Module 2 is remotely reconfigured by Blink to become a limited functionality storage device instead of a backup device. Understand the difference. And your Blink app on your phone is automatically remotely reconfigured to remove functionality you had with the free trial subscription.  So don't buy the Sync Module 2 thinking it will provide the functionality you lose with an expired subscription.  And don't think you will be able to purchase a Sync Module 2 right up front with your Blink Minis and start using it for local storage when you setup the cams instead of cloud storage because the trial subscription is automatic and prevents the Sync Module 2 from functioning as a local storage device.  It only functions as a once a day backup device.  Like you need to backup the web to your local device.  I always thought it was the other way around, backup your local devices to the web.  So you have to keep the cams and module for over 30 days before you can even check out the Sync Module 2 to see what it does and how it works.  I purchased a Sync Module 2 and a 128 GB USB stick to use with it for my Minis and it was for nothing - no added functionality at all.  My Minis are sending the motion triggered recordings to the trial subscription cloud storage for the next 27 days whether I want it or not.I'm not happy about the Sync Module 2 but the Mini does do what I wanted for a minimal cost even without it.  My goal with the Blink minis was to be able to check in on my other place when I'm not there during the winter months just to see that its still standing and my cars are still in the garage.  I wasn't looking for a constant viewport that is always recording in an endless loop nor did I think I was buying a serious thief catching security system.  For that I have a professional security service with expensive overpriced equipment for all doors and windows, smoke, fire, CO2, detectors, etc. and high monthly fees so that someone somewhere receives all the alarms 24/7 and calls the police immediately.  That is a real security system.  For me these Blink cams are a peace-of-mind curiosity system. In that respect I think its going to serve me well.Your satisfaction will vary greatly according to your expectations for the Blink Mini cam and also the Blink Home app and also the Blink options for functionality, from 1. its the worst piece of crap ever made with the primary objective being to upsell amazon Alexa video devices and cloud video storage plans (oh, and unlocking almost all of the cam's functionality) to 2. its a really great product definitely worth the price so I want to get more.  Are you expecting a serious security system with unlimited live viewing and local storage of video with all the features they list for the system with a subscription and cameras with the latest, greatest resolution and features?  You will be in the first, very disappointed, category.  Are you looking for a curiosity cam that lets you check in on your place once in a while via your voice controlled echo, fire-tv stick or the Blink phone app for minimal cost?  You will be in the latter category, I love the Minis.  Are you looking for an inexpensive cam with off-site cloud storage and added, some might say needed, functionality provided by a low cost subscription?  You should be happy with the Blink Mini.ProEasy to setup and use with Blink app and Echo Show devices (although android app has some known issues that might cause some frustration during setup)When I had to call tech support because of an issue with the Blink app on Android, the wait was not too long and the rep was helpful and pleasantVery inexpensive way to drop in and check on a place momentarilyNo subscription or anything else needed for this basic functionalityWith or without a subscription these have good valueConAll features beyond live video feed require a subscriptionNo documentation included at all, you must search the web for everything you need help with or info aboutNo clear explanation of what you get without a subscription, in fact, purposely obfuscated as a marketing planNo clear explanation of what adding a sync module 2 will do for you if you only have Minis - not muchCheap 1080p video - its ok, it works, but we are going into 2023 so how about an upgrade to 2k this yearCheap minimal mounts that are intended for mounting on horizontal surfaces like a shelf and deficient adjustment for vertical surfaces like a wall (curiously the exact opposite of the outdoor cams that are intended to be mounted on a vertical wall and not good for horizontal mounting like under a soffit).  Had they made the mount a little longer it would have been so much better but it probably would've cost a couple cents more.To get the features you think you are getting you need the subscription. In Blink's defense, the subscription is currently reasonably priced and any serious security must include off-site storage of data (to prevent loss by fire or theft) or its just a curiosity system anyway. Their marketing approach for it is very poor though.Blink needs to step up to the same level of customer experience as Alexa devices provide.  And I think if you pay for prime it should include the Blink cloud subscription for up to 4 devices and only pay if you have more devices than that.  How about Bezos holding off giving away some of those billions and put it towards excellent customer satisfaction with its products and services.It should not be so purposely confusing as to what you actually get WITHOUT a subscription. Starting an automatic subscription upon setup of a camera to conceal the lack of functionality without out one until the 30 days has passed is a pretty shady business practice. Internet based tech companies get away with unchecked deception and shady practices as standard operating procedure, and its not just Blink, its all of them. Its too bad because for people who know exactly what they are getting, the Blink Minis are a great product even despite this.  I think it backfires on Blink by raising people's expectations very high only to find out 30 days later that they now have to start paying a fee to keep those features they thought were included with the purchase of the device.  And so they become haters of the product and company.  You can see this in many reviews.  This does not seem like a good long-term marketing plan to me.I hope this helps you make an informed decision whether to purchase the Blink Mini cams.  Now if you purchase them you can be very happy with them based upon your correct expectations of the product.",

      "reviewTitle": "Wonderful Headphones for the price!",
      "reviewDescription": "Unfortunately, I fall victim to being clumsy and often breaking / losing my headphones and earbuds- and when both my computer headset and everyday headphones broke, I almost died- and came to Amazon for a solution as many others before me have.I am a MAJOR FPS gamer. Specifically games like Overwatch and Call Of Duty. I had previously owned A pair of Steelseries Arctis Novas for my setup, and LOVED them. The sound quality is crisp and you're able to clearly tell where players are.I also really like good music headphones. Previous to these headphones I had used Beats, which, were good music quality, but falling apart.Since I lose and break headphones a lot, I didn't trust myself to go all in with an expensive headset. Through scrolling, I found these.Now, for the review.I LOVE THEM! They are very cozy. The material used for them do not feel cheap, and the speaker part of the headphones has lots of  swivel opportunity. The cushioning is very well made, and with 4+ hour gaming sessions they do not ache my ears-they actually fit inside instead of the earmuffs instead of sitting on them!Audio wise, I can safely say, this is on par with my old Steelseries Headset. This is what really worried me, because crisp sound is very important in the games I play. Almost instantly, this headset proved it could handle that. It picks up all footsteps I need to watch out for gaming.Microphone wise, I use an external one at my desk, so I cannot entirely speak on it.As for music, this headset dominates that as well! Very rich in bass, and, if you download the app provided, you can boost it further which I adore! Vocals and everything are honestly, better than my Beats headphones.The noise cancelling is okay. It's nothing Apple level, but it certainly is enough to drown out noisy roommates, bus rides, or food halls you encounter. The transparent mode is also very useful for when I have to unfortunately listen to what's happening around me.Another very wonderful addition that I HIGHLY recommend is the app this headset comes with for phones. It controls the audio mixer for extra bass or less treble, has buttons for noise cancelling / transparent mode, and the best feature? You can connect multiple devices.It sounds basic, almost unneeded, but I didn't realize how much such a small little addition goes. Game queue times too long? Thats fine, my headset is also connected to my phone so I can scroll tiktok. Need to leave your friends on call for a second? Still hear them and do whatever you needed downstairs with your phone.The battery life is also very nice! I only have to charge them every few days, even when I do have those longer gaming sessions!All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this headset if you are looking for a new reliable one to replace your old ones. With sound quality of headphones ranging 100$+ USD, this is an absolute STEAL! I have been practicing being gentle with them because I never want to break them.(P.S. For all my fellow computer users or gamers using this headset, I highly recommend connecting it through your computer's Bluetooth, not headphone jack! Noise Cancelling is not available through headphone jack, and the audio sounds just the tiniest bit worse- nothing too irritating though! If you have an audio mixer app on your computer like me, there might be two options of headphones to pick from through Bluetooth. Do the STEREO audio option. You are welcome! :D)",

      "reviewTitle": "Best ANC and Sound in it's price range!",
      "reviewDescription": "First off, this is not a comparison between the Anker Soundcore Q20s and any product from Bose or Sony.. That is an unfair comparison as they are not even in the same ball park.. I know that most people want to get an understanding of how comparable they are to those but if you aren't willing to spend the money on those, you aren't going to get near what they offer..That being said, for this price range these are the best hands down.. One hit KO.. I'll list all the features separately so they are easy to find and read about.Active Noise Cancellation:Let me get some things out of the way, I work at a gas plant in a landfill as IT and Data Reporting.. My job is noisy sometimes.. I hear a constant hum from the motors in the plant right outside my door all day long.. I also travel a lot from the various plants we run.. While ANC is on these headphones won't block out immediate talking next to me or sudden loud noises, but they do block out the noise from the plant.. That is without the music.. I do need to point out that the talking is trying to talk over motors so it's louder than your average office space. When the music is on and running, it adds a whole separate layer to the cancellation as I can no longer hear anything else..Sound:I don't typically have music up loud, most I've turned them up to is 50% because I've been rough on my ear drums since I was a kid playing drums at a young age.. As I've gotten older I've been more prone to try and protect my ears.. That being said, the sound quality is very nice with or without ANC engaged.. I find it's way more enjoyable with ANC on due to everything else being tuned out.. Some headphones will warp the sound when ANC is turned on, these do not.. The sound is as impressive with the feature on as it is off.. This is incredible.. I listen to a range of music from Rap and Hip-Hop to Metal and Hard Rock and they all sound clear and precise in these headphones..They do have a bass-up feature that increases the bass a little more.. This works well without muddying the sound quality too much.. I imagine if you increase the volume too much it might diminish but from my listening around the 50% max it's been outstanding.. Bass gains can be a real hit and miss for me as some lose sound quality.. With these that's not the case..Quality:The headphones feel amazing.. They have a nice weight to them (which is not for everyone). I personally like a little weight to my equipment.. It is sturdy and feels solid.. I was afraid of it feeling a little too plastic like but they really don't.. Now they aren't as nice as your $200-$300 headphone, but again, their price range they are amazing quality.. The ear cups are very comfortable and soft memory foam.. I was actually surprised that my ears don't get as hot as normal.. They will overtime due to the design.. It's impossible to get around since it traps heat, but these seem like they don't get as warm as fast.. Also the ear cups feel amazing.. I've literally worn them all day yesterday and felt no ear fatigue or strain.. This is a solid!Functionality:A feature that isn't talked about a lot with these is the awesome ability to connect to not just one but two devices simultaneously.. Now a note on that: You cannot listen to two devices at the same time.. What is going on is I'm able to connect to my computer and listen to music on it while being connect to my phone at the same time.. When someone calls me and I answer, it swaps input to my iPhone and stops playing the music in my ears.. Once the call is finished, it swaps back to my computer and I resume listening.. This is an amazing feature that I use daily!Battery:The battery is very nice.. When I received my unit the first thing I did was pair it to my devices (of course) and started checking it out.. I received them with 60% battery.. I used them the rest of that day at work for a couple of hours.. then when I left, used them a little more at the house and watched half of a movie on them before going to bed.. They were still at 60%.. The box says that they last 40 hours and that is accurate.. If you don't use the Bass-Up technology you can squeeze even more.. and to not use the ANC it goes up higher.. 40 hours for battery life though is incredible for this price range.. I cannot complain!Packaging:The packaging was very nice and well put together.. It came with a charge cable and 3.5mm aux cable (which is great for my Nintendo Switch when I fly).. While I would have loved to seen a USB-C type adapter (as would many others) that is still an expensive change to make and would probably bump the price up out of the $60 range.. I understand from a manufacturing point the reasoning to possibly go with a micro-USB.. It would be nice for C, but it is what it is.. That doesn't change how well this thing is made and works.. The only gripe I have and it's a minor thing is the case they come with.. Well, you can't call it a case cause it's just a bag.. Now, it's a very nice bag, but I throws these buys in a backpack with a laptop and iPad and Switch (in a hardcase) and so a bag doesn't really protect your headphones.. Luckily I had a nice hard case from a cheap pair of headphone I received a few years ago (the case was the nicest part) and they fit perfectly.. So if you don't have one buy a hard case for them..Overall:Overall, for the price these are the best hands down.. You really cannot beat their ANC and sound quality for this price.. I will definitely buy these again and probably buy my wife some so she'll stop stealing mine.. If it was out of 10, I'd give this product a 9/10 simply due to no hard shell case..",

      "reviewDescription": "The sound quality is outstanding, with deep, powerful bass and clear, balanced audio. They are incredibly comfortable to wear, even during long listening sessions, thanks to the soft ear cushions (the material for these are very decent). The Bluetooth connection is stable and provides excellent range, allowing to move around without any interruptions. The battery life is impressive, lasting through the day on a single charge. The headphones also come with active noise cancellation, which is perfect for blocking out background noise and immersing oneself in music or podcasts. Overall, these Bluetooth headphones are great so far.  They provide a high-quality sound, comfort, and convenience for a reasonable cost.",

      "reviewDescription": "Premium Sound Without the Premium PriceThese JBL Tune 520BT headphones deliver incredible value for the money. The sound quality rivals that of much more expensive headphones - with deep, rich bass and crystal-clear highs. I'm consistently impressed by how good my music sounds through these.The fit is excellent, with just the right amount of clamping force to create a good seal over the ears without being uncomfortable. This helps with both sound isolation and audio quality.Battery life is outstanding. I can listen for days before needing to recharge, which is super convenient for daily use.If you're looking for high-quality wireless headphones that won't break the bank, these are an excellent choice. They punch well above their weight class in terms of sound quality and features.",

      "reviewDescription": "Update (1/31/25) I finally had to recharge them last night. I don't have an accurate run time, but it's close enough to the claimed 57 hours. Fast-charges with a USB-C charger that can handle that. Still sounds great, still an excellent value, still five stars.Good: Comfortable, sounds great, much less lag than my old bluetooth earbuds, controls on the right earcup are reasonably easy to use by touch. Decent price for JBL.Bad: A bit heavy, presumably because of the oversized battery enabling that claimed 57 hours of run time.Bottom line: I haven't bought JBL equipment in quite some time. Nice to see they haven't lost their touch. These fit well and sound great for the price with low enough lag to game with them. I haven't tested the claimed 57 hours' use time yet, but the initial charging was quick and, if they come anywhere near the claimed recharge interval, I can forgive the extra weight. Five stars.",

      "reviewDescription": "JBL has been a pretty solid brand for me in the past and these were $30 when I purchased. Worth the money. Good sound quality. Not the best but for $30 you would probably be hard pressed to find something significantly better.  If you are needing headphones with a 3.5 mm jack this does not have one. It is strictly Bluetooth. These headphones are fairly small; probably ideal for a child but they do work for adults as well. The small size make them good for a pair of travel headphones.",

I do not believe this was the design, only the extended period that I was wearing the headphones. Really good battery life.

It had missing screws when we went to open the cover. The right hinge for the screen was missing all three screws. Managed to fix things by re-centering the screen and adding the missing screws. We believe we were sent a refurb, as there were dirty fingerprints inside.  Also, the body is not \"full-metal\", it is plastic. Other than that, it works very well.",

      "reviewDescription": "Worst computer I‚Äôve ever owned. I bought this to edit videos for my YouTube channel. First thing I tried to do was download the editing software. Super slow. Then it kept saying that it couldn‚Äôt download and couldn‚Äôt tell me why. So I tried to download another editing app and it said no memory available‚Ä¶. But my 2 1/2 year old outdated iPhone has room? The kicker was trying to get my stuff off of this laptop so I could send it back. I had customized everything and then when I tried to reset it, it kept saying ‚Äúreset unavailable‚Äù (again, after taking FOREVER thinking about it‚Ä¶. How can a new computer with nothing on it be this slow???) Had to have a tech nerd friend help me clear everything. What a joke.",

      "reviewDescription": "Pros: Sound quality, fast charging speed, long battery life, stylish design, will last for years, price, good for audiophiles and metalheads.Cons: First use pain but adjusts over time, stocked ear muff.I'm a long time beats fan. I needed a new replacement solo 3s since my old ones broke. These headphones are absolutely amazing!!! I would 100% recommend them. They're really loud, great sounding bass, and semi noise canceling. The quality on them is ok it's not bad I recommend replacing the ear muffs first they start to crinkle up after a 2 months. Durability wise they last for quite a while I've had mine for over 4 years and they are still working well and good shape and ionquality and still sound just as they was when I brought them. The beats charge really fast as well, they last for 48hrs, I use my beats for a whole day and it never goes pass the 3 light bar. I love the color the sleek black is stylish. They do squeeze your head when you first get them but you have to break them in for a while to get used to them. For people who wear glasses I can go about 8-12hrs a day until I feel pain from them squeezing with my glasses on, I recommend readjusting the glasses len arm a bit or the headsets and tht works wonders for me.",

      "reviewTitle": "Great Sound and Long Battery Life",
      "reviewDescription": "I recently purchased this for my daughter, and after hearing her input and trying them out myself, I‚Äôm impressed with their performance and design.Pros: 1. Sound Quality: The bass is punchy and powerful, which is great for genres like hip-hop, EDM, or pop. The mids and highs are decent, though they might not satisfy audiophiles looking for perfect balance. For my taste, the mids and highs for Rock genre weren‚Äôt crisp and a touch flat. 2. Battery Life: The battery life is phenomenal‚Äîup to 40 hours! My daughter only needs to charge them once or twice a week, even with daily use as a student while doing homework. Fast Fuel charging is a great option, giving 3 hours of playback with just a 5-minute charge. 3. Design and Comfort: These headphones (silver) look sleek and modern yet not so large every head turns when you walk into a room. They‚Äôre lightweight and fit snugly. The foldable design makes them travel-friendly, easy to toss in a backpack or gym bag too. 4. Connectivity: These pair seamlessly with our iPhones. The connection is strong, and switching between devices is effortless.Cons: 1. Price: At the retail price, they seem a bit expensive for the sound quality you get. However, I got them during a sale, which made it worth it. 2. Comfort for Long Sessions: While they‚Äôre comfortable for a couple of hours, extended use can make them feel a bit tight, especially if you wear glasses.Verdict:If you‚Äôre looking for stylish, bass-forward headphones with excellent battery life and solid build quality, the Beats Solo 3 are a great choice. Just keep in mind that they‚Äôre not the most comfortable for marathon listening sessions. Overall, I‚Äôm happy with the purchase and would recommend them, especially if you can get them on sale!",

      "reviewDescription": "Beats**all coming from an airpods & airpods pro 2 user**Two notes about me:* I have a pretty average sized head & ears* I wear glassesThoughts:- Noise isolation is way better than people give credit for, works about as well as the active noise cancellation on my airpods pro 2.- I can FEEL the bass.- Can hear all kinds of details in music (like when I upgraded to airpods pro but slightly better than even those). The AirPods gen 2 did that for me, then the AirPods Pro 2 did it again, and now these are doing the same.- Electronic music sounds absolutely amazing. Better than any other headphones or speaker I‚Äôve heard.- Classical sounds amazing‚Äîway better than AirPods Pro 2.- Folk sounds amazing, & it‚Äôs like someone‚Äôs playing a really high end guitar right next to me while also serenading me.- Piano also sounds especially amazing- Case is slightly padded, but leaves a lot to be desired there‚Äîthey also barely fit (see pictures).- They feel durable, even at hinges (which shocked me).- They DO fingerprint easily, if that matters to you.- Box is very sleek & giftable.- Not having the automatic ear detection is really nice for when I lift one side up to hear someone or something.- They are more comfortable than AirPods Pro, even with memory foam ear tips on those. But they do get slightly annoying with glasses but there is a sweet spot where it‚Äôs not bad (if I angle the headband towards the back of my head instead of having it straight up and down). But it‚Äôs not so uncomfortable that I don‚Äôt want to use them. Merely a minor inconvenience.- I ever so slightly wish I could see the battery percentage on my phone while charging, but it‚Äôs not any real inconvenience.- The micro-USB charger is potentially going to be a slight inconvenience because they wear out‚ÄîUSB-C or a lightening cord would‚Äôve been way better.- Pairing with an iPhone is extremely easy.- The included carabiner for the case is a nice afterthought, but it‚Äôs a super flimsy carabiner and the loop keeping it on the case is tiny and I wouldn‚Äôt trust it. If it were better sewn and had a bigger loop, that‚Äôd be fantastic. I CAN attach an aluminum locking carabiner, but it‚Äôs just barely big enough for that.- Charging seems pretty fast, and while I do wish it would show me the percentage while charging, I really appreciate seeing the percentage in the battery widget while connected because other non-apple Bluetooth headphones don‚Äôt have that and I‚Äôm left guessing how much is left on the tiny control center icon with those.In sum, I HIGHLY recommend these if you‚Äôre looking for good bluetooth headphones and don‚Äôt have $400+ to spend. I snagged them for $99.95, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. They‚Äôre definitely a good value at $200, but they‚Äôre mind blowing at a part-time, minimum wage budget. Almost every feature has been either mind blowingly fantastic, but those that aren‚Äôt are barely worth commenting on.Are they perfect? No. Should one expect perfection at this price? Absolutely not. I‚Äôd highly recommend buying if they‚Äôre in your budget!!!",

      "reviewTitle": "Much better than their wireless options!",
      "reviewDescription": "The camera itself is good. It has a decent picture quality and a lot of customizable settings.  I purchased the doorbell camera, Outdoor 4, and two indoor/outdoor Mini 2 wired cameras. I have had the issues with battery life on both the doorbell and Outdoor 4 cameras. I highly recommend purchasing the Minis instead if you don't mind using a wired connection. I find them much more reliable, and you don't have to compromise by lowering motion detection sensitivity or video quality in the hopes that your battery will actually last. They also have a light on the camera itself that will activate when the camera starts recording, depending on your settings.I love the customizable motion detection options. You can mark places in the field of view to block the camera from detecting motion in specific areas, so if the wind blows a tree won't constantly detect motion. But when it does detect motion from a person, it sometimes stops recording before the person leaves. This is more of an issue in the wireless Blink cameras, but it has happened with the Mini 2 as well, albeit to a lesser degree. You can choose the length of each clip and how long it takes for the camera to detect motion after beginning a recording, but it sometimes fails to recognize someone is still in frame when recording, so it doesn't capture what the person is doing or where they go after the initial motion trigger.One other thing that frustrates me about Blink's system is their app constantly uses an incredible amount of power and overheats my phone. I have to force stop the app at least once per day to preserve my battery life, which means I don't actually get any notifications to my phone when the doorbell is rung or when a person is detected. It's also a little frustrating that I can't choose notification settings for each camera individually, and some of the notification options are hidden in the phone's app settings and are not accessible directly in the app.Overall, I like the camera, and much prefer it to their wireless options. I reached out to Blink about poor battery life with the wireless cameras, and I find Blink's response frustrating and disappointing. I hate that I am going to need to buy some third party accessories to make some of my cameras actually work properly so I don't have to change the batteries every week or two. I have to spend even more money on things I shouldn't need, and that I wouldn't need if Blink either made products that actually do have a longer battery life or else were at least honest about how poor the battery life is.I have also seen several reviews mentioning a delay in the app for notifications and when trying to play live video. I haven't really had an issue with this since I got my internet set up at my new house, so I suspect this is likely an issue with internet speeds. Prior to getting internet I was using a mobile hotspot to provide the internet connection and I did notice such delays when I was doing that. The other thing I have read that can cause a delay is low battery, which I haven't really noticed now that I have fast internet, but it could just be because I really haven't been paying attention.",

      "reviewDescription": "I‚Äôve been using this smartwatch for a few weeks now, and overall, I‚Äôm quite impressed! The design is sleek and comfortable to wear all day, and the screen is bright and responsive. The fitness tracking features, like step counting, heart rate monitoring, and sleep tracking, are accurate and easy to use.The battery life is decent, lasting me about 2-3 days on a single charge. I appreciate the notifications for calls and messages, which help me stay connected without constantly checking my phone. However, I wish there were more customizable watch faces and a slightly faster charging time.Overall, it‚Äôs a great value for the price and meets most of my needs. Perfect for anyone looking for an affordable and functional smartwatch!",

      "reviewTitle": "Nice starter level smart watch",
      "reviewDescription": "If you aren't sure you want to invest in a high end smart watch, try this one out first! That's what I did during the sales at Christmas and I'm pretty pleased with it. I've never had a smart watch before, but I have a heart condition and COPD and wanted/needed a way to track my heartbeat and my O2 over time and my nurse suggested a smart watch. I bought this one, which was very cheap at the time on sale, and overall I think it was a good buy. It meets my main need and tracks my O2 and my heart rate, recording everything over time so I can download it to my phone daily and later show my doctor or nurse my numbers for the day or over a week or month. This feature works great, storing all the info in my phone where it's easy to scroll through and see the timestamps on any odd readings. The battery life is awesome, I only need to charge it about twice a week and it charges quickly plugged into the USB on the front of my computer tower. And the phone relay feature works fine, letting me answer a call even when my phone is in the next room so important calls don't get missed.This watch might well be five stars for most people, but I'm picky and there are a few features that annoy me.  Top one is I can't just turn off the features I don't use. I'm disabled and in a wheelchair most of the time, and I really do not need to track my steps. lol  Second feature that I find annoying is the dial. Yes, I can put my own wallpaper in and did immediately, but you can't change the clock layout at all on the \"custom dial\" or add any other little mini readouts to it like are visible on the prefab dials which mostly track steps and dieting, which I don't need. Third feature I dislike is needing to manually sync daily to keep my information. My memory isn't so great and I'm sure to forget!  Fourth is the sound for the call relay feature, in both directions. I hardly use it so it doesn‚Äôt bother me a lot, but for someone wanting to talk on the watch often it would probably be more of a problem that it can sound crackly sometimes on both ends of the conversation.  Finally, I didn't like the band at all, which was too rigid for me, made my wrist sweat, and was kind of cheap feeling with a plastic buckle. The band honestly reminded me of the ones that were on the cheap plastic watches I wore as a kid back in the 80s. I replaced it immediately with a stretchy woven nylon one that is much more comfortable and doesn't make my wrist sweat.Overall, this is a decent quality, very useful watch. For me it's a solid four star because I like it and will continue using it even though it's not perfect. When the time comes to replace it, I will probably spend more to get a more customizable watch, but for my FIRST smart watch, this one is pretty good!",

      "reviewTitle": "Good beginner smartwatch",
      "reviewDescription": "I wanted to try a smartwatch to see if it's something I want to use long-term. For less than $30 this seemed like a good fit. Other than for time/date, I'm using it to send me text and Teams notifications and notify me of phone calls. I haven't tried actually taking a call on it.It does a great job with those notifications. I hardly ever miss a text, message, or call now.  However, it can't handle long texts, and emojis just show up as \"messages is doing work in the background.\"I'm not really into tracking steps, but I did a 100-step test the other day and it was surprisingly accurate. So I've left that on. The app is surprisingly good for a watch at this price point. I was expecting worse.What don't I like? It's a rubberized band, which can get annoying. If I keep using it I'll probably replace the band. And the watch is a little bigger than I'd like. It gets caught on my shirt cuffs a lot. If I upgrade I'd probably opt for a smaller watch face. All in all it was well worth the price.",

For today, it tells me I have taken 4637 steps, but my Fitbit tells me I have taken 5718 steps.So my conclusion is it‚Äôs a nice digital watch but not necessary smart.

The only thing I don't like about them is that they don't have blocker on them and the batteries don't hold for long if you leave them off the charger throughout the day! I can talk on the phone for an hour or two and then I notice the charge starts to go down on the phone about halfway never mind it's been sitting on the charger for two days straight. Other than these two matters, the phones are great and do last for at least 5-8 years if not longer. I highly recommend these phones to all because they're so good! The volume is great, and functionality of use is with ease! You can't beat the price for as many phones that's in the set! The color is really nice too because it will blend in with most colors/decor in homes! I've never had any problems since owning this set of phones other than one of the phones keys would get stuck after long use. Besides that, it's a wonderful everyday exceptional phone set!! I just hope V-Tech doesn't stop making this particular model/set! 10 Stars and more!!",

It's easy to see who called last. Set up is simple just plug them in.",

      "reviewTitle": "can't read the screen, as it is too small and not bright enough",
      "reviewDescription": "Sorry to say, it isn't nearly as good as my old panasonic that finally wore out.  It was easy enough to set up even though directions were on one large sheet with many folds, so it was hard to locate specific directions.The biggest disappointment is that the screen is SMALL and on dim side.  Almost impossible to read most of the time.  May be OK for younger people with better eyesight--definitely not for seniors.  The voice quality is also little tinny. But, It wasn't too expensive and it was on sale after Thanksgiving.  So far it works as a landline, but I tend to be old school and depend on a landline more than most.  I will probably use it for awhile, then toss it.",

      "reviewTitle": "OK phone. No match VTECHs excellent 2431 GIGAPHONE.",
      "reviewDescription": "This phone replaces two VTECH 2431 2.4Ghz GIGAPHONES that I've had for over 21 years and really loved. One phone developed an issue with the keypad (buttons were becoming hard to press) but still worked. The other started developed an issue with static on the line so I thought it would be a good time to replace them...and this was the closest match. Unfortunately, the excellent 2431 is no longer available. I like the reliability, voice quality, range, and features of VTECH phones. However, thisphone is only OK and definitely no match for the 2431. There are a few features I don't like. First, as a few others have mentioned, this phone does not have the MESSAGE WAITING LED of the older 2431. This was a blinking green LED on the top of the phone to indicate that you had new voicemail. You could simply glance at the phone, even from across the room, to tell that a message was waiting. The LED was also duplicated on the base station. For this phone, the only way to tell if there is a new message is to lift the phone off of the cradle to light up the display and look for the VM envelope icon. Not very user friendly. The second thing that bothers me is that there is an annoying bright RED LED on the front of the phone to indicate that the phone is in it's cradle and charging. The phone sits on mydesk and this LED really bothers me. It's too bright. Would prefer if VTECH changed this LED back to a green MESSAGE WAITING LED. That would be a more useful feature. Perhaps move the CHARGE LED to the base instead. This is being picky, but I'm also not too crazy about the ring tones. I prefer the tones on the 2431. Also, the 2431 base was a full featured speakerphone that included a keypad and duplicated the buttons on the handset and included LEDs for MESSAGE WAITING, POWER, LINE IN USE, and HANDSET CHARGING. Even without the handset, you could make calls from the base station as well as use the base as an intercom. For this phone, the base simply has a \"find handset\" button and LINE IN USE LED, no speaker phone feature. The speaker phone feature is only available on the handset. Although it looks like the base speakerphone  features are available in more expensive models.",

      "reviewDescription": "I had to replace my aging Galaxy S3 Frontier which is at it's end of life. I love that watch! I was going to get either a Galaxy S6 Pro or a Pixel Watch 2. After much soul searching, I knew I had to make a decision. so the gambler in me decided to try something new.  I'm glad I did!Now clearly, a watch released less than 6 months ago is going to out perform one released 6 or 7 years ago. But  the improvement in performance is remarkable.It's faster responding, pairs quickly and easily with my Pixel 6a smartphone, and has superior software.It's really the software that makes the smartwatch useful and productive. And to Samsung's credit, they kept my old war horse's software current.  But, the Fitbit software is much more modern than Samsung Health. It can scan barcode label on food packages when I record what I eat and it is much more flexible in terms of how the nutrient servings list is recorded.  And that means less manual calculations when trying adjust servings from grams to, say, ounces.Heart monitoring is more accurate, stair climbing is much more accurate, and sleep monitoring is actually usable. It might be the advancements in sensor quality rather than the software algorithms. But I do trust the results more.Charging the battery is FAST.  I get about 36 hours of life from the battery, on about 45 minutes of charging. Twenty minutes of charging while I shower in the morning will give me about 12 hours of battery life.  The wireless magnetic charger is a little different from the Samsung watch, but it is very functional. The user needs to make sure that the crown and stem is parallel to the power cord, and once the watch is about an inch away from the charger, the charger is drawn to the watch magnetically and it leaps up and connects to the watch. This is not BS on my part, it happens everyday. Only once has this connection not been made perfectly.The PW 2, is smaller and lighter, physically.  It's about the size of a traditional men's mechanical dress watch. My ancient eyes can see the slightly smaller screen with ease.  My arthritic gorilla fingers akso have no problem manipulating the screen.  It is comfortable to wear long term, even to bed, for sleep monitoring.  It offers a more classy and elegant appearance than the larger and sportier S6 Pro.I was comfortable with the new user interface within a day or two; so I think people coming from another brand won't have a huge learning curve. Like the Pixel Smartphones, Google uses a simple and uncluttered interface that I found very intuitive.I am quite pleased with my purchase,and can recommend it to others.",

      "reviewDescription": "My doctor recommended an Apple watch for heart monitoring but I am in the Google realm so this was my watch of choice.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a smart watch so this one seemed reasonable for what it does.Overall, I do like the watch and wear it daily.I charge it at night and if I forget then in the morning when I get up.This tracks all kinds of stuff and is just a great way to see what I am doing activity wise.Also the heart monitor was helpful...And lastly I like that you can customize it and change the face with free / paid faces on the google store.One thing to do ASAP is switch out the band with a breathable non-silicon type of band.",

      "reviewDescription": "So I quickly learned after getting the watch a few days ago to go into the watch's settings, click battery, and turn on the battery saver. To have your watch come on, you gently tap the screen or press the crown button. This has greatly improved the battery life. But YOU shouldn't have to do that with a watch that costs this much.On the plus side, you can change just about every setting imaginable, and the Fitbit is a nice touch (despite most of the good features behind a subscription service). That's called Google greed. You'll get used to it. They're a monopoly for a reason. Using it to make and receive calls is awesome. Got a call the other day and was able to talk as I washed the dishes. No earbuds are required. The person who called me said the audio was great.I highly recommend this if you don't mind the craptacular battery life. I'm surprised they didn't fix it with a software update. Something is feasting on the power. Or they went with the lowest bidder for parts.Oh, if you have fat fingers or medium-sized ones, forget about the keyboard. LOL. You'll need a stylus (yes they work). The speech-to-text is very good but you have to remember to say \"period\" or \"comma\" when composing messages. If you don't, it'll be one long sentence without proper punctuation. You can even say \"heart emoji\" and it'll insert that. You can also go back and edit the message with your fingers and use the keyboard to correct mistakes. I'll update my review if needed and the longer I use it. Oh, the ECG works and is very cool. Even the sleep monitor caught my apnea.",

      "reviewDescription": "I got the 47mm Watch Ultra. I had a hard time spending so much on watch, but now that its on my wrist, I'm so glad I got it. This is the best watch I've ever had; better than I had expected. Everything works as advertised, plus lots of fuctions. The screen is so big, it's easier to use than other smart watches I've had. The battery is really strong; I use it a lot at work for 12 hours and still go home with at least 75%. It keeps a charge better than my phone does. The microphone and voice-to-text works great. It's loud at work and the mic on my old phone couldn't hear me but this watch hears every word, crystal clear. Connectivity is great; I've had no problems with Bluetooth or WiFi, but I don't use the 4G so I don't know about that.My last watch was 42mm and this is 47mm. It looks and feels huge, but with the trail band, this is the most comfortable watch I've ever had. It's the most customizable watch, too.I'm left handed, so I wear my watch on my right wrist. This is the 1st watch I've ever owned that I could invert, so the buttons are facing my hand. I can finally use my fingers for the buttons instead of using my thumb.I'll update with pics later.",

It charges really fast which is also a pleasant surprise. I workout daily and it hangs in there just fine. The face is big and easy enough to read.I honestly just love it and I am surprised by how much I like this watch and very pleased with the purchase.The apps also work well but are not always perfect- one example is that I was watching a movie with my kiddo and the watch thought I took a 2+ hour nap and there was no way for me to edit that, which was a bit annoying, but I'm not expecting things like that to be perfect. Most of the time those types of apps are close enough or spot on.",

      "reviewTitle": "Great starter camera - Photos are ok quality",
      "reviewDescription": "The camera is lightweight and easy to use. It has multiple functions such as manual or auto-focus, zoom, timer, and burst. It also comes with a wide angle lens which I haven't figured out yet. I brought for myself as a birthday gift to start a hobby because I'm always taking photos with my phone at friends and family gatherings. If you plan to take lots of pictures I recommend buy a strap for around your neck. As I mentioned, it is pretty lightweight so no strain around the neck. Also buy a lens cap. The wide angle lens has a cap but the regular camera lens does not. One of the best features is that you can connect to wifi and load photos to your camera. It does take a bit to transfer but still pretty convenient. If you want a fast transfer just connect to your computer. My only complaint is that the picture quality is just ok. At a recent event I took photos with the camera and my iphone. The camera photos were a bit darker than the iphone pics, even with the flash on. Photos using the iphone \"potrait\" feature were me bright and crisp than the camera. Overall it's a great camera to start with.",

      "reviewTitle": "Surprisingly versatile camera for the price!",
      "reviewDescription": "I was sincerely surprised by the overall quality, build, and the flexibility, compact size, and options that were available in the camera settings. I had wanted a camera I could carry that I could use for b-roll, vlogging, or backup usage, but after a few days of using it, I was impressed by what it can do. The vivid and bright view screen flips forward for vloggers to be able to see themselves, and the only downside is that it cannot flip inwards with the screen towards the back of the camera for better protection. The camera came with a 32g card, but I replaced that with a 128g scandisk. With that and the two batteries (and the included charger), for the price on here, you seriously can't go wrong. It's a great starter camera as well for anyone young or old wanting to get into photography or videography. The flash doubles an EXTREMELY bright video light. The camera options are easy to use, and there are a lot of options. I do highly recommend this. I use it mounted to an arm over my drawing desk to capture footage, and am thinking of getting a second one to carry with me daily.",

LOL  ah, yes the days when we got excited to get a few free apps or games on our new phones... alas those days are OVER bro! get you a variation of the moto g device family. Out of the box, she is pretty amazing. I didn't have a single complaint really. Super fast, tons of storage, great camera, new updated apps, lots of customizing, etc. JUST WONDERFUL. After a few months it happened, the dreaded update in April I think it was, maybe March, I now have 400+ apps. (I will attach a pic, it shows 399, there have been about 30-40 more that have trickled in since the initial dump, which took about 5-7 days to finish up... and 75-80% are \"system apps\" (bloatware from any and every carrier in fact.... ALL. OF. THEM.) For example, a bluetooth app for t-mobile, & verizon, & sprint, & metro, && cricket. Before you say, \"just uninstall them and move on!\" - I did. I have. I've factory reset twice and they're just BUILT INTO THE phones disk memory. There simply is no \"delete\" them. Some of them, as duplicatory as they are, messing around with them can still brick up your jawn within a few clicks... and before you even start, you are not a dev... so chill, I mean neither am I... but you just stay out of that menu, that app, and that folder. Really, who knows why they name everything in tech sketchy stuff like \"com.sys.IM-WATCHING-YOU-PAM.000\" and \"<%real/secret/23-LISTENER999>... but anyways... JUST PROMISE ME, YOU WON'T GET INTO THAT APP, OR FOLDER.... okay?So Motorola should reimburse me for having to put myself through IT school to teach myself to operate on this phones guts and remove all these garbage apps manually to create the phone I thought I purchased. All you can do is force stop and disable them. Buuut I still feel like they are gathering data, bc, why wound't they be. Its not just this model either, my partner has the moto g stylus 5g and its even worse on theirs. the play store basically never gets a break from constant updates (and then theres the transferring of precious data to the mother ship)yeaaaa we also had to upgrade our home internet plan and router because of all this. We couldn't both use the wifi at the same time doing anything at all. it was crazy. allllllso the apps are gathering intense amounts of data and ALL WANT crazy permissions that have nothing to do with the app itself. like the calculator wants camera permissions... nuts. The sheer number of apps that require making system changes or having total device control... it was too much. I would almost ask for a refund, but from what I see these days most phones are leaning that direction, making money off our god given ones and zeros.... and then still try and look at us in the eyes while they sputter out the retail price of the next generation of your favorite device. can't even hold it down on a free case or something..THEN - - when you finally get a break from force quitting and removing permissions that, somehow keep TURNING BACK on... you might have a few minutes to enjoy a quick photoshoot. NOPE. the camera app it comes with stinks, it just soooo basic.. so then you think, oh, i'll download a cool camera app off play store... NOPE. theres a fricking governor on the camera. That makes it so NO 3rd party camera app will get full usage of ALL THE MEGA PIXELS YOU PAID YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY FOR (48 megs to be precise, which is overkill, but still, you will be lucky to get to use 10 or 12 MP!!)Seriously. And JUST as google starts conveniently implementing the awesome 2 step verification, and authentication keys.... JUST in time for you to have to answer to your wife about why you don't have as much info in your google takeout as she does... yikes... oh and squeeze on some more of that exact same conversation about your FB activity as well.. yaaaaay.So, let me get this straight... I now have to REMEMBER ALL MY UNIQUE PASSWORDS && double log in, && verify 3 ways, all to check a notification thats just a promotional email about the new apps GEWG will put out next week. AND then FINALLY the google security come forward to say they don't trust my log in (bc i've got a VPN) - - - (from guess who - G1 - duh!) and they really cant tell the difference between MY REAL actual login on my trusted device from what it must assume is a HAKKr logging in 3 states away. . . . . . E.V.E.R.Y. LOG - INNNN!at this point i am thinking about a jitterbug and some stress eating of sour worms to relax.but yeah the phones cool, other than that.",

The screen sensitivity is good, it doesn't overheat and comes with a charger. It's not a fast charger, but it's average. It has many advanced features as well, as it did come out is 2024. The phone is kinda large, still fits in pocket but not all the way. It's pretty customizable, but not as much as I would like. Also it hounds you so much about signing in and Google stuff every 5 seconds during setup. It automatically buzzes with each key, but that can be changed which I did. It had cool features, such as picking it up to silence it, turning it upside down to turn on Do Not Disturb, and much more. There is so much to this phone, you'll definitely need a users guide video to help you out on YouTube. The manual isn't very helpful. Great phone, great price!

We needed something for my mother who is 88 and really hard of hearing and these met our needs. when i showed her the sound boost button it was even  a bit loud in her ear, so i know as her hearing gets worse this phone will still make it possible for her to have a conversation on the phone without it needing to be text or TTY. The display screen is significantly bigger and really easy to read. The flashing light on the top that doubles as a flashlight is nice making it easy to see that the phone is ringing. The larger buttons are so much easier for her to use with her arthritic hands. This is really  a fantastic phone.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is caring for the elderly or that has arthritis in their hands or is hearing impaired.",

      "reviewTitle": "Nice Phone for Money, but Not Necessarily for Seniors",
      "reviewDescription": "I was impressed with this phone on unpacking, and liked the compact handset and functionality. I had purchased it for my mother who has dementia and is hearing impaired. She had been trying out one of the picture phones, but the sound was totally deficient considering these are made for the elderly (check this feature out carefully if you are buying one). I thought this Panasonic phone would be simple enough to use and provide the decibel level we were missing with the picture phone.The interesting thing I learned in trying to teach her how to use this phone is that we basically need to relearn how to use a cordless landline phone, as many of us haven‚Äôt used one in over 20 years now. Most elderly innately understand the original corded handset that you hold to your ear and replace in the base to disconnect. Where the cordless landline is more similar to a cell phone (which my mom had been using for the past 15 years or so), there are some key differences that are critical to the proper usage of this phone. Primarily, the phone line must be disconnected at the end of the call. That requires the user to tap the OFF button or replace the handset in the base. One party can disconnect a call on a cell phone, a landline requires both to disconnect. This can be dangerous for seniors who fail to end the call properly, and leave the line open.  You can‚Äôt text them and tell them it‚Äôs off the hook either!  Secondly, placing a call requires two steps as opposed to one. Even the ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù button (which ideally would be labeled) covers ALL ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù, so requires multiple button presses to reach the desired party. I was the only Favorite designated on my mom‚Äôs phone, but it still required two taps to make the connection.  As an aside, even though I advised my mom that there were essentially only three buttons she needed to know, the busy display and sheer number of buttons and labels was likely overwhelming to her.Our tests with the Boost feature didn‚Äôt seem to be too successful, as the only step we took that made the calls clear enough for her was using the speaker phone. I personally would have labeled the speaker phone ‚ÄúSpeaker‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúSp Phone‚Äù, as I think the former is more recognizable terminology.  I also think the speaker should be a major button, not a minor one in terms of size as it is so commonly used.  Likewise, I think ‚ÄúEND‚Äù would be clearer than ‚ÄúOFF‚Äù, but these are just my opinions.Because I did not get to utilize many of the other features, I withheld a star from my rating, but that does not indicate any disappointment with the phone‚Äôs performance. If I had a landline, I would love this phone and even debated keeping it for myself.  I think it is well-designed and while not necessarily configured intuitively, it still packs a lot of functionality into one compact phone. The ability to purchase it with multiple handsets is a big plus.  In summary, my only issue with the phone was its potential unsuitability for a senior, particularly one with hearing or cognitive impairment. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a good phone for the money.Footnote - Panasonic gets extra points for including a diagram on the top flap of the outer box on how to repack the phone. This packaging was an engineering feat on its own, and repacking it in the same configuration would have been impossible without the diagram!",

Panasonic continues it's tradition of standard AAA rechargeable batteries, included in the box, so it really is a plug and play operation.If there is anything to complain about, the plastic they chose for the front of the phone can be a little slippery but the phone is large enough so you never feel like you are going to lose your grip.All in all, hard to go wrong with this one.",

I can't comment on the microphone or phone support because I don't use them to talk on a phone.  I bought these because a more expensive bluetooth headphone I bought was way too bass heavy.  The sound of these is acceptable.  It's still a little more bass heavy than I'd like, but at least it doesn't sound like I'm standing inside a sub-woofer.  I primarily wear them to listen to the radio or music when I'm in a noisy environment, and they work fine for that.",

      "reviewDescription": "I have had a pair of these headphones for at least 6 months, and I am very impressed! The battery lasts a very long time, I normally use them everyday for at least an hour, and I only have to charge them about every other week. They also charge pretty fast, which is an added bonus. I think that they also sound really good! I did think when I got them that they felt a little flimsy, but they have held up great! So, for the price I think that they are the best headphones out there!",

      "reviewTitle": "Great PC - Poorly Packed - No WiFi Adapter",
      "reviewDescription": "The PC arrived in 2 days as promised. It was packed in an inner box that was a few inches to big. It could slide around. And the outer box was way to big with no packing! In spite of that it came out undamaged. The boxeds themselves showed no signs of damage whatsoever as did the PC. Whew.Upon booting up and attempting to install Windows I hit a snag. It didn't see a WiFi adapter so it wanted me to use Ethernet. I don't have an Ether connection in my office/music room because it would be impractical requireing breaking into the walls and repairing and repainting. So I installed a USB-3 T-link WiFi adapter and rebooted. The install then proceeded fine. Later I opened the unit and as far as I could tell the WiFi module is missing. I contacted Amazon and they gave info to contact the seller. They were more than helpful. I opened up the older Dell XPS unit I'm retireing and it had a M.2 WiFi adapter. I decided not pursue installing an M.2 adapter because of the 2 VERY delicate intennae in the XPS. The XPS has a plastic top where the new one was all metal. I'll either install a faster USB adapter or a PCIe adapter if I need more speed.The PC looks like new. The windows install went fine. I'm satisfied 100% with the PC. Packing not so much. It did include a DVD R/W that I didn't expect. It compares with new units that cost twice as much.It is plenty fast enough for what I do and runs windows 11 and should be OK with the 24H2 when it comes back out. The XPS was not compatible with Win 11. I'll salvage the drives from the XPS and e-waste it.3/13/24 EDIT:I found the PC had a SSD with a known high failure rate. Basically a no-name brand. I replaced it with a Samsung SATA drive from my old PC. It still has ~ 98% of its life-- some 88 years!I also ordered a PCIe X1 TP-Link card which frees up one of my precious rear panel USB ports.I'm happy with the performance but with these issues there might be better deals at Amazon or elsewhere.",

      "reviewTitle": "very good computer",
      "reviewDescription": "I ordered this computer as a full tower because I wanted space inside to add a hard drive.  Before it was sent out, the company offered me an upgrade.  I declined, since I wanted the full tower for the space.  Two weeks later, I received my new (SFF) small form factor computer.  The first thing I did was open it to find there is an empty full size bay for an additional hard drive, along with the power and data cables.  Nice!  This computer is apparently new, not refurbished, for the same price.  The first problem I had with installation was using a 28 inch Visio TV as a monitor for setup.  The picture jiggled so badly I couldn't continue.  My solution was to place the new computer in its permanent setup with a regular monitor and attach the old one to the TV.  The included cordless keyboard is slightly warped, so typing is difficult.  I know I could fix it with a piece of cardboard, but I chose not to.  It has no on/off switch.  The mouse is the type with no on/off button and has to be clicked if it is left for more than 2 minutes or so.  Be careful where the cursor is when you wake it!  Both the keyboard and mouse have a common nub that plugs into a USB port.  Windows 11 is another long story, and would only drag down the quality of this hardware.",

      "reviewDescription": "These are as advertised! I purchased them in the blue color and that is such a cool hue! They fit perfectly and have interchangeable tips which are very comfortable in the ear. The sound is terrific, just as good as Apple Ear Pods.And for the price of 20.00, well you would be a fool not to buy them! And, if you miss the sale, I think the original price is only 129.00....still a great value.A good feature is the charging window on the front of the case that tells you exactly the power left on the pods.I would recommend these!",

      "reviewDescription": "Decided to give these a try after reading pretty good reviews so I decided to buy a pair as a backup for my Soundcore P40i. I'm not disappointed. Actually, they sound better out of the box then my P40's did, and I really like my P40's. They paired instantly with my Fold 6, and decided to test out the punch with a house track Wacuka by Avaion. The sound was crisp during the lead in and at 1:03 when the bass dropped i was pleasantly surprised. These sound amazing. TBH, they may become my daily set and sadly my P40's may just be relegated to use at work or whatever. Durability remains to be seen, but they feel good so far and appear to be built well. Plus the green looks amazing in direct light.",

      "reviewDescription": "Look, just hit buy and be consider it a great purchased. Read on if you want more details.Got these ear buds on sale, just from a browse through Amazon they popped up and at such a great price I had to take a closer look. Purchased them thinking they‚Äôll suit for a backup pair to my Jabra set for when I travel or just forget my set at home. Packaged arrived on time, the packaging was all well put together and they came pre-charged. Popped them out and they connected easily, so much so that I was surprised how quickly. From there i played a frew winds, listened to some pod casts, and took calls. They come with small, mid, large ear piece size if you want to change out and a charging cable for the case.Tested them out for a week just to confirm I could rely on them. What got me was the noise cancelling capability, also the charging case that told you the % charged on the face. You can aalso easily run with one earbud if you‚Äôre out and want to keep one in for calls, not typically something I do but tested it and they work fantastic.They are just smarter than my Jabra set that i have currently. They didn‚Äôt disconnect or have issues with one bud connecting or not the other (which can be a problem when each ear piece has its own smarts). Regarding play time, I didn‚Äôt test out 48 hours, but during the week I never had issues with running them for 3-4 hours straight at a time, they always showed 70% remaining or more power then back in the case.Lastly, instructions were written well. I know that seems odd to call out in a review but often when you buy a lower price electronic item you see two things, first quality / connectivity will be poor and instructions will be in a poor conversion to English. Not here, instructions were excellent and with pictures for all the features regarding the ear buds and their respective operation.Great purchase, highly satisfied and will go in as a great set for work / play when needed‚Ä¶..",

      "reviewDescription": "I‚Äôve been using these wireless earbuds for a day and am really impressed! The sound quality is fantastic, with deep bass and clear vocals‚Äîperfect for music and calls.The battery life is amazing‚Äîit looks like I can go days without charging it, and it only loses a few points after nearly four hours of music, thanks to the case, which gives me multiple recharges. The earbuds fit comfortably and stay in place, even during workouts or long listening sessions. Plus, the IPX7 waterproofing means I don‚Äôt have to worry about sweat or a little rain.Calls are clear and crisp, and the AI noise reduction does a good job of filtering background noise. The only minor downside is that the touch controls can be a bit sensitive, but once you get used to them, it‚Äôs not a big deal.Overall, these earbuds are a fantastic value for the price, and I‚Äôd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for great sound, comfort, and long battery life!Would buy again! üëçüèºüéß",

      "reviewTitle": "A Refined OM-1",
      "reviewDescription": "Wrote my first Amazon review ever to say that people are being silly about the free battery thing. I wrote about the camera first and battery promotion second, so people can skip that if they just want to read about the camera. Maybe I'll write a full review of the camera someday, and include some pictures, but all you really need to know is that the OM-1 II is superb. If you want more than that, here's some more to consider:If you are coming from another camera manufacturer:Ergonomics are some of the best out thereWhile being around the same size as many full-frame competitors, the OM-1 is usually ~0.5lbs lighterAutofocus and tracking is a step behind the best from other companies, but is still very capable, the best of any Olympus / OM product, and many Olympus lenses have the wonderful pull-back manual focus ring in case you need or want to take overImage stabilization is amazing, I can handhold a 600mm full-frame equivalent with only body IS, in the middle of a hike, and not have much trouble keeping it steadyImage quality is good enough for most professional uses; biggest downside is a lack of detail and size from only being 20MP, but if you can use the high-resolution modes, 50 and 80MP hi-res shots will get you ~80% of the quality of an actual high megapixel cameraBattery life is great; if you leave it \"on\" on, the battery will drain much faster because of the screens, but quick sleep greatly increases the amount of time, and if you are actively shooting tons of bursts, you can expect thousands of pictures on one battery. I managed ~5 hours and ~4,000 pictures on a battery before realizing later that Bluetooth On was keeping the camera from quick sleeping the whole time.And lastly, the computational features are what makes this camera truly unique. Maybe you still want to use neutral density filters, a macro rail, or a tripod, maybe you still want to take multiple exposures to process in post; you can still do all that. The OM-1 makes it possible if you don't. If you don't want to carry a tripod, you can still get long exposure shots. If you do, you can focus stack in camera. If you don't want to carry or switch out neutral density filters, you can still benefit from the effect. If you do, you can even combine them; ND filter on lens, GND on camera. It's very freeing to be able to casually go out with only a camera and a few lenses, and shoot however you want without feeling, \"man, I should have brought this or that.\" And if doing professional work, maybe it'll make your life a little easier. If you still want to use and carry all your gear, that's fine! But you might also try these features out, and realize this is good enough for this shot or that shot, maybe I can spend a little less time switching out some gear, or lining a tripod up, or this one less step in post. How much benefit you get out of what this camera can do will absolutely vary, but what I think makes this camera special is that it just makes it easier to be creativeIf you are coming from an OM-1:Rubberized dials are great; maybe slightly easier to turn accidentally, but much easier to turn when you do want to turn themStabilization is a little better; I struggled at times to handhold the 75-300mm on the OM-1, but find it much easier to do on the IIAutofocus and tracking is a little better; C-AF+TR is actually useable now, and with subject detection on, C-AF has tracking completely integrated into it to where there is no option anymore to have C-AF or C-AF+TR with subject detect on, only C-AF; you may or may not like this change, but it makes it easier for me, because I normally used C-AF for no subject and C-AF+TR with subject, now I can just leave it on C-AF instead of switching every time there was or wasn't a subject (personally, it feels like the AF slows a tiny bit if you leave subject detect on, but there is no subject, as if it's spending a little more power \"looking\" for one, in case you wondered why I don't just leave it on all the time;) still can lose a subject or eye, but better and most importantly stickier in generalBuffer is much improved; you can still fill it easily using super fast bursts, but you will get twice as long before that happens, and if you shoot on the slower ProCap modes like 5,12.5, 25fps, you'll probably be held up more by your SD card speeds than the bufferLive GND is very nice and intuitive if it's applicable to the type of shooting you doOM has stated that some II features aren't able to be ported to the OM-1; What could and couldn't work on the older camera is tough to say without being OM and knowing all the technical details, but they have also said that besides increased RAM, the memory system has also changed, so while some features might be possible, it may be extremely difficult or impossible to get them to the same level as on the II, like the improved AF performance and Live GNDAfter spending more time with the II, it does drain the battery faster than the Mark I; this is reflected in the CIPA rating (520 vs 500 shots,) and is also noticeable to someone who has extensively used them both; battery life is still very good, but this does seem to give some more credence that the initial amount of RAM was holding OM's cameras back somewhat, like the processors were always powerful enough, but the data they had access to at any given time was so limited, that they weren't working as hard as they could beIf you are coming from an older Olympus camera:Just about everything will be improvedBetter stabilization, autofocus, tracking, battery life, high ISO performanceNew menu system which can still be a little labyrinthine, but is sorted out much betterMuch faster sequential shooting speedsHi-res shot is much faster to process and hand-held if it was only tripod before, stronger filter effects for Live ND, some computational features entirely depending on what Olympus you're coming fromHope this proved worth your time reading in some way, and maybe even helped you make a decision on your next camera purchase.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About the free battery promotion:On Amazon, you don't just order the camera and expect an extra battery to be in there. You needed to add both the camera and battery to your cart in order to qualify for the free battery promotion. If you did this, the battery isn't actually free; Amazon discounts you the majority cost of the battery OFF THE CAMERA (mine was also split into two separate orders: -$3.24 off battery / -$86.54 off camera when I purchased it.) The promotion is no longer going on, but if you did read it, it did in fact say to add the battery to your cart as well.If you did do this, and didn't receive the battery, then yes, Amazon is at fault for not sending something that shows up in your Order page as being properly ordered, and should rectify the situation by sending a battery.If you didn't do this, then understand that this is how Amazon handles their promotions. You can try contacting OM, and if they are nice about it, they might send you one, but they are in no way obligated to, because this promotion is being handled by Amazon. OM doesn't have anything to do with it except telling retailers, \"if they order the camera during this timeframe, offer them a free battery however you do that sort of thing.\" You can try contacting Amazon, but it doesn't look like people have had much luck with that, and if you didn't follow their procedure, they're really not obligated to help either. If you try to take advantage of a promotion like this on Amazon again, just double-check that there is something in the order that does look like you're getting the item and for free (it is in your cart and $0 or some part of it is discounted,) and don't expect that Amazon is randomly throwing in an extra battery on their own in the package. OM isn't sending them a pallet of batteries with every pallet of OM-1s, and Amazon has one bajillion warehouses, they might not have any of the batteries in the same warehouse as the cameras, if they could even tag order pickers to grab a battery for every order of this camera during X amount of time.",

      "reviewTitle": "Very good camera",
      "reviewDescription": "As most reviewers have noted, Amazon does not ship the spare battery noted in the product description, and they have apparently since deleted that offer from the product description.  Too bad they ripped off multiple buyers first.  There are numerous professional reviews of this camera on line by people far more experienced and knowledgeable than I, and you should read them if you truly need to know more about what this camera can do.  Currently all I am doing is photographing fast pitch softball, and this review will almost exclusively focus on that.  I also do occasional wildlife and landscape photography and camera features such as pro capture, focus stacking, and exposure bracketing can be immensely valuable in those settings.  I have used those features on Olympus (predecessor to OM) cameras, but have not yet used them on this camera.Pros.  I have been blown away by my ability to use high ISO with very little noise.  In my previous camera (Olympus M1X) my default ISO was 800 and I would never go above ISO 1250 because of very significant picture degradation.  I shot my first game with Auto ISO just to see what the camera would do.  It sometimes used ISO higher than 10,000 and I never observed any significant noise.  I still find this unbelievable.  A player's face is a small part of most softball pictures, but it is also a vital part, and automatic ISO did periodically produce a mild over exposure of players with fair skin and a mild underexposure for players with dark skin.  It is adjusting for brightness on uniforms, infield, etc., not just on the players' faces.  This is a minor inconvenience and requires some post camera editing, but Auto ISO saved many more pictures than it lost.  When I am focused on a batter in shadows and the runner on 1B tries to steal 2B in bright sunlight, it is not possible for me to manually change my exposure settings in time to take a series of pictures.  Auto ISO does it for me effortlessly, and makes fewer mistakes than I make when adjusting the camera manually.The auto focus system is vastly superior to my previous M1X, but still occasionally loses focus for no known reason.  If your target is not moving too wildly this camera has a number of tracking systems which will follow your target for you.  However I frequently make wild swings between targets (I'm basically trying to follow the player closest to the ball) and camera tracking does not seem useful to me.I have a love/hate relationship with the speed of picture taking.  I prefer to use a Mechanical Shutter so I can hear exactly when my camera begins and stops taking pictures.  My old M1X and this camera both advertise that they take 10 pictures per second (frames per second or FPS) when using the mechanical shutter.  However the 10 fps on  my M1X appear to be slightly faster than the 10 fps on the OM Mark II as I got fewer pictures of the bat actually meeting the ball with the Mark II.  I switched to the electronic (or silent) shutter at its lowest speed of 20 fps and effortlessly obtained pictures of the bat meeting the ball.  However 20 fps also means that when I finish shooting a game I have approximately 3,500 pictures to sort through instead of the approximately 2,000 I used to get.  Yes I get pictures I would have missed using the manual shutter, but I also get too many pictures I would have missed with the manual shutter.Cons.  The camera is complicated and requires me to learn a number of new tricks even though I was previously using an Olympus camera.  This also means it has lots of cool features, but I'm too old to enjoy learning new tricks.  The camera accepts two memory cards, but after I filled up one card yesterday it would not automatically switch to the second card until I manually removed the first card.  There is undoubtedly a simple way to get the camera to switch, but I have not yet learned it.This camera only accepts one battery (it is designed to be light weight) so I have had to go back to carrying an extra battery in my pocket.  I really liked that my M1X accepted two batteries.",

      "reviewTitle": "Very Good Watch for the price",
      "reviewDescription": "First off I am not a bot. This is a real review by just a regular normal guy. This is a really good watch for the money. It has all the features of a high end smartwatch but without the high cost. It looks nice while wearing it. I thought the face would be really big, but its actually a perfect size for my wrist. It lets you answer phone  calls  and read text. You cannot reply to text only read because you have no keyboard, but that's ok for me at least you can read them. You can change it up and customize it anyway you would like through the Zepp app. There are a lot of free apps and custom watch faces on the app that you can download for free. The health features are all great ,Heart rate , o2 stats and the exercise apps are all really good and keep track of multiple types of exercise like walking, running, and bike riding. All the health functions sync really well with my I-Phone.  The sleep app is really nice .You can keep track of your sleeping habits. It lets you see how long and how well you slept through out the night.  The charger charges the phone quickly and you can use it for 8-10 days depending on what apps you are running in the background.  You have to download the Zepp app to use the watch but its really not that hard and the app is very good. Its really easy to set up with the set up QR code. It comes packaged in a nice box with the charger and the user manual.  The charger  works very nice but the cord is a little short Its magnetic and it will only connect it the correct way every time. I have an apple phone and it syncs very easily to it with no issue and the Zepp app is in the apple App store. There is an Alexa link up on there so you can use your Alexa but I am not an Alexa guy so I don't really use it ,but who knows I might in the future at least its there.  All in all I say this is a great watch with a lot of very useful apps and functions. If you want a budget watch with all the high end function of an expensive watch this is for you. I really enjoy the functionality and the ease of use.  5 stars all the way. Signed-- Just A Normal Guy.",

      "reviewTitle": "So far I'm impressed.",
      "reviewDescription": "I had a Wear OS watch that died and wanted to replace it but that wasn't in my budget. I tried several smartwatches with my Samsung phone running Android 13 with mostly bad results; none of them did everything they claimed. Very frustrating. I wanted a circular style yet I kept looking at the BIP 5. Honestly, the only seller I found that would answer my questions honestly was Amazfit. So I gave it a chance. Glad I did.I've developed Android apps so I'm familiar with the \"inner workings\" as well as being a retired firmware engineer and one of the things that ticks me off is the fact that many Chinese watches aren't properly designed. For example, Notifications in Android are visible to all apps loaded by the OS design; Android flags them by which app generated it. Many of the watches just read some specific Notifications that they have designed their code to use and ignore others. This means, for example, if you are using Samsung Email instead of Gmail and the watch only accepts Gmail then you will never get email Notifications. This is a major problem because I couldn't find any watches that worked with everything and I found NONE that worked with a Calendar app...until this one. Based on descriptions and questions I asked, evidently to the Chinese \"Calendar\" means it will display date and time.Amazfit's Zepp app is designed to take better advantage of Android's features. In particular it seeks out all apps on your device and allows you to select whether you want Notifications from specific apps. To that purpose it uses Android's generic functions so when you look at the list you find them all. Using a different email app than Gmail? No problem. Using a messaging app different than Google Messages? No problem. Using a Calendar? No problem.I exercise often yet I usually don't wear my watch when I do because I've been known to break them. I do like using some of the fitness features yet those are usually just monitoring steps and heart rate; I have an abnormally low heart rate so I was surprised to find just how accurate the Bip 5 is for that. I can't attest to the other fitness features.I wanted a watch that could run all day without needing charging; my former Wear OS couldn't do that on busy days but most of the time it would last a single day only. The Bip 5 with heart monitoring on every few minutes has use 9% of the battery in over 24 hours so I suspect 10 days is a good estimate; I will probably charge it once a week.I wanted SMS and MMS Notifications because most \"group conversations\" are MMS; none of the watches I tried or researched would do that yet Amazfit said theirs would...and it does! Note that if you get a \"true\" MMS it notifies you that it was received but not show the video/image but I don't care about that. I just wanted to know I got a message so this works great for both SMS/MMS.I want my Calendar events on my watch...and I get them!I want to see calls coming in on my watch with the ability to reject them...and I get that!I want to get email on my watch...and I get them!I want to have a quick response to emails on my watch; Wear OS allows you to type anything but I found myself only using \"canned suggestions\" 90% of the time and usually preferred using my phone except for OK, Yes, etc. The Bip 5 allows you to reply with canned responses that you can edit...so I can do that.Supposedly I can instigate a call on the Bip 5; I haven't found that and never used that on my old watch so I probably don't care if I find that setting. For grins, I answered a call using the Bip 5 and it worked well although I wear hearing aids so I probably won't make a habit of that unless it is really quiet but it does work.Basically, the Bip 5 does the 6 things I wanted: read texts, answer texts with canned replies, read group texts, get events from my calendar, get my emails, and lasts more than a day. And it does so without drama.I honestly don't really care for the basic watch faces and didn't want to buy a custom one, especially since I wanted a round watch. To my surprise it comes with a \"photo\" watch face that you can customize with any pic you want that displays date/time over it and another optional message. I really like that so I uploaded a favorite pic. You can make multiple versions of faces, such as seasonal pics, and the app will keep them so it is easy to switch them. I only have two so far so I don't know if there is a limit to how many but it is nice to have.I read some negative comments about the Zepp app yet those were old comments. It seems well designed and easy to use. To be fair I wrote software/firmware for 35+ years, including a lot of User Interfaces so I'm better versed than most people when it comes to testing the limits of code yet honestly it looks and works pretty well. Better than a lot of other watch apps I tried.",

      "reviewDescription": "I had ordered a pair of Beats Studio Pro over ear headphones and as soon as I put them on, I knew I had to return them.  They were tight, the ear cups felt like they were squishing my head and after a few minutes, when I took them off, it was sweet relief.  I did some additional research on Amazon reviews and found a lot of people with sensitive ears really liked these JLab JBuds Lux ANC Wireless Over Ear Headphones.They had different shaped ear cups (vs Beats) and weighed less based on the product details, so I placed an order.I can report they are indeed lighter and WAY more comfortable than the Beats Studio Pro.They are beautiful (I purchased the Mauve - a dusty, soft, neutral gray-purple).They are comfortable.  I wore them around the house for hours without issue.The battery life is great.  After a full day of house cleaning with them on, it still says it's at a full battery level!The bluetooth range is excellent.  I left my phone plugged into the charger and went out of the house, downstairs, upstairs and to the backyard and the connection held up.The sound is great.  The noise cancelling works well, and I enjoyed the 'Aware' setting that allows you tohear ambient noises in your immediate area.The app it comes with is helpful to customize (hoping they will come out with a widget to go with the app).I didn't think much of this brand when I would come across it on Amazon but I am a SOLD customer now!They don't come with a case, but that doesn't matter to me.  You can pick up a third party case  or stand if you need one (plenty out there).They also fold up like their competitors, so easy to toss in a bag and go.Great price point, quality product that beats the pants off the...Beats!",

      "reviewDescription": "I usually keep these at work and they last DAYS before recharging. I have absolutely no problems pairing, they cover my ears completely, have great volume and easy to control with the buttons on the side. Speaking for durability, I have dropped these, banged them around on walls and gotten dust on them and they‚Äôre still holding up months later. There are SOME complaints though.The first would be that it starts getting uncomfortable if you wear a beanie or a hood under them for a long time (hours without taking them off). It starts feeling like your ears get sore from the squeezing, not that big of a deal and it goes away when you take them off.The second is having noise cancellation activated in the wind. You get a harsh rasping that seems to be picked up by the microphones and it gets really annoying, again, no big deal, with just a tap of a button on the side you can turn it off and get no more noise coming from the wind.Overall, definitely worth the price.",

They comfortable cradle your ears without adding excessive pressure on your ears or head. They're good for longterm use.

      "reviewDescription": "Note: I Legit just received these and am writing this. I am not writing this with any personal experience of long term use. These are just my first impressions.Pairing these to my iPhone was super easy and quick which is much appreciated. The quality of the music does sound good, however I am no expert so for someone with more advanced knowledge or preferences they may feel differently but for an average user these will meet expectations (I just wanted something for the gym). You can play music pretty loud but I do fear there may be slight audio leakage if turned up too high. They are very comfortable- I barely feel them on my head so that‚Äôs nice as I do tend to be sensitive to anything squeezing/pulling on my head/hair (even when wearing glasses they fit nice). And they don‚Äôt look too bulky or weird as some headsets can. It does come with a charger which is nice and seems pretty self explanatory on that end- bonus if you have a new gen iPhone cause it‚Äôs USBC. The buttons on the side of the headphones are nice to adjust volume if you don‚Äôt want to pick up your phone.Overall I‚Äôm satisfied with these so far just for casual use. They check all the boxes I was looking for- decent quality at a good price. I‚Äôm hoping they hold up through time. So please take all my feedback with a grain of salt.",

      "reviewDescription": "This watch has great features.  It's stylish, comfortable to wear, and very convenient. I use it mostly to count my steps, so I don't have to carry my phone. But it displays texts well, and the vibrating notification signal is easy to feel without being annoying. I love the call feature for the convenience once more of not having to carry my phone everywhere. The variety of watch faces is impressive. I've gotten several compliments on the appearance of the watch. It holds a charge for about 3 days, and the magnetic charger is very easy to use. Overall, I am amazed at the quality of the watch, especially considering the low cost! It paired easily with my Samsung phone, proving again that we aren't limited to Apple products or their prices. I highly recommend this watch!",

      "reviewDescription": "I was looking for a new smart/fitness watch that I would be able to purchase in my affordability range. I was searching for one that met all of my features requirements:1. Standard date & time easily displayed by default on the watch face.2. Programmable alarm.3. Step tracker.4. Sleep tracker.5. Blood pressure measurement.6. Pulse & Oxygen measurement.7. Stress level tracker.8. Long operation time between charging.9. Quick charge.10. Compatibility with multiple mobile devices. (In my case a Samsung S24 Android smartphone).11. Easy to learn/use device app.12. Nice watch face screen designs.13. Nice wristband that wears well, in which the extra length of the band can be kept out of the way, and doesn't come unhitched during use.14. Is not incredibly expensive.After a long search, I came across this beauty. It has ALL of my requirements, plus quite a few more features I never really thought of. For example, the watch is able to monitor TONS of different specific types of sports played (like basketball, football, and even DANCING). It is able to save each one separately.The watch comes with two different design styles of wristband: one nicely decorative, the other much more basic. I LOVE the fact that the more decorative has a hoop aside from the hitch that you can tuck your extra strap length through to keep it out of the way, as well as keep it from being damaged and unhitched during use.As a bonus, it has a very nice selection of watch screen faces. The app gets updated with new types of designs, as well. My design I liked best was the analog, traditional watch face with arms (the kind this new generation of kids usually don't know how read). I chose the design that echoes my favorite art/design era of Art Deco.If you are looking for a wonderful smart/fitness watch, one with very robust features for a price that doesn't break the bank, I highly recommend getting this one!",

      "reviewDescription": "It's easy to set up. It's cool that it will monitor your heart rate your and your sleep patterns letting you know if you go into deep sleep or light sleep. It also measures your stress. Also gives you advice on how to breathe LOL. I don't really enjoy the sports mode One you always have to remember to turn it on, but you also have to find the particular exercise you're doing in that moment and it has a wide range but not wide enough. I have found that the battery life is not as long as they say. I get 4 days before I have to charge it. I know it says waterproof but I've yet to take a shower with it because there's a difference between water resistant and actually waterproof.I think my biggest complaint is that because it's not a Fitbit or one of the mainstream ones. The app doesn't like to communicate with other apps. I am using MyFitness app to calculate my dietary calories. Unfortunately Google fit does not sync up well with it because it's not a Fitbit or one of the top 10 of that app. So I'm finding that my steps are not being calculated properly. On average, I do 17,000 steps a day 20% of the time. Those steps are calculated properly. The rest of the time it will show maybe 12 steps or completely zero. If you're willing to go just off your watch, this is a great fitness watch especially for its price point it will not break the bank and it does calculate a lot of your calories for you.",

      "reviewDescription": "I've bought a few of these Wyse cameras now and my only regret is not buying them sooner. They are so easy to install, set up, and works the app. The cost of the service is very affordable at around $12.99 a month. You have two walk talking with these camera's. Meaning not only can you tell people to get off your probably now they can talk back and tell you what they are doing there. Or you can ask the mail person to hide the packages so your other half doesn't see them when they come home. They also have a spot light and a alarm.The app is amazing and so easy to work. You can do so much within the app. Like zoom in on the picture or vehicle. You can set the range of your camera's. They have night vision and so much more. I highly recommend Wyse Camera's and I've tried multiple different camera's including Ring and Wyse is much better and more affordable.",

      "reviewDescription": "after going through 2 of Reolinks outdoor cameras, and it failing to stay connected, reconnected, disconnected again and again, I gave this a try, and is was stunned at the ease of install, effortless connection to wifi, the pan and track feature is something to see in action. The night time real color feature is awesome. The price, ease of install, good app for phone, and able to install on PC using Bluestacks makes these cameras a must buy. Being wired for power, the camera never stops or shuts down since there isn't a battery that limits viewing. Its been a week and I have those two running on a monitor 24/7. Totally worth it, reolink is a bust and a buggy device, but Wyze has the goods and proves it every time I look at the screen with that clear color picture.",

      "reviewDescription": "Bought on Amazon , took a while to finally make use. Setup was one of the easiest of the 2 wyze cams I've owned and still use. Image is great. I use it to nanny cam my pizza oven outside while prepare the pie dough inside, relieving a ton of stress.  With the fire going brightly i can't make out any details of the flame or read the temperature gauge on the oven but that's a contrast issue obviously but it's working fine and will serve such purposes as nanny or security.  Low light color image is quite good. I've had connectivity problems long term with my older versions but eventually they cooperate. So far this one has been fine though admittedly not had long enough to say.",

      "reviewTitle": "Great Product - But Cable Issues",
      "reviewDescription": "Review is on 2023-03-12.Having owned the Wyze Cam V3 as my introduction to the brand - moving to the Pan V3 was almost a natural path. It's a great camera for a great price. The bulk of the company's money seems to be made on the subscription side, so the hardware price is sold with minimal markup it seems.The camera itself - hardware and quality - are not much different from the regular V3. Good picture quality and such. There are 3 primary differences between the Pan and the regular V3.1 - Panning capability. The camera can turn - not 360 - but almost.2 - Not magnetic. Must be mounted on the provided base - or similar item that the screw can fit.3 - Micro USB cable is right angle and not straight.PANNINGThe camera can turn almost in 360 degrees on the base. It has what's called \"waypoints\" where 4 areas can be set and the camera will automatically move to each area once selected within the app.The camera supports time-lapse and motion following.NOT MAGNETICIf you wanted something similar to the regular V3 that you could stick somewhere - this won't do. Based on viewing the Pan V2 - they are similar in terms of the base. This does make some sense since the base can swivel, but it's something worth noting.USB CABLEThe regular V3 has lots of cables available that are weatherproof. Finding one for the Pan V3 - and I guess the V2 as well - is very tedious. The right-angle cable needs to sit inside the base of the camera and I've not found any extensions that have this feature. If you're going to purchase a third-party cable, you need to ensure that the micro USB end is about 19mm/0.75in so that it will fit snugly inside the base of the camera. This means you MUST use the original cable. I've not seen a similar right-angle cable on Amazon or even on the Wyze website - so there's no replacement. Another option - which I've done - is to buy an extension cable that is compatible with the device. I had a regular USB2.0 extension cable and it didn't work - guess it doesn't carry the voltage as well. Waiting on the linked device to arrive and test.https://a.co/d/3dER0lLI assume I'll either have to heat-shrink or tape the connection between the original cable and the extension. If someone else has seen the cable or something that will work - please link it within your review or as a reply to this one. The items below were found on the Wyze forums and linked here to make things easier.CABLEhttps://a.co/d/4ravLGoTAPEhttps://a.co/d/ceonpX3Additionally - if you're technically inclined - you could cut the cable and solder it to a different extension. Persons have said in the Wyze forums that it's only power - no data - so just 2 wires are required. Do that at your own risk.UPDATE - 2024-01-02So now. Having had the device for some time, I've used and abused it a bit and have more details to add for the review. Both the V3 and the PAN has had some weird issues for me. I'll get into those individually.V3 - I recently decided to go on vacation and didn't want my cat to be left without food. While my current solar setup isn't 100% - it provides enough power until about 2AM and the area is secure enough that a dead gap isn't a problem. I really just need the cameras to monitor my cat. So a typical \"pspspspspsps\" call to get the cat to come around is used along with the name - but strangely, the camera seems to cut out with errors once this is done. Almost like it dies - has some firmware issue - or something. I'm going to test and see if it's the sound or pitch, but I've really not tested voice on any of the cameras for more than a few seconds previously. To get the attention of my cat I need like 1-2 minutes per camera. When the camera goes offline, it needs to be manually power cycled in order to be available again. Since my solar setup dies and comes back, that works out for the V3 somewhat, but it's concerning that the cameras have a flaw where extended voice or a sound/pitch will cause them to suddenly go offline. You may need to test this with your own cameras to verify.PAN - the V3 PAN has an even stranger issue. While it seems to share the same issue as above, it also seems to factory reset the device if there's the audio function usage or even periodic power cuts - which happens based on the solar setup I've got going as explained above. Again, this is concerning. I have to climb up on a ladder to physically reset the device and rescan the QR code to have the camera available again. This is very inconvenient.With those problems in mind, I think WYZE should have an option to \"re-add\" a camera that's giving issues. That way any existing configurations including waypoints can be kept and you don't have to do everything over from scratch - including sharing the camera with family members if you do that.Again - hopefully this review helps and persons can be aware of potential flaws. Overall - still a great camera and the functions of the PAN are good.",

      "reviewDescription": "Years ago I purchased an expensive Sony camera and had issues with it right away. It was complicated to figure out and sat on my shelf untouched for 5 years. I didn‚Äôt like the picture quality and felt like I could never get clear photos and the color was not great.So I‚Äôve Been using my smartphone for years but finally decided to try another camera. After watching 1000 YouTube videos finally decided on the Canon r50 because I wanted something I could use for videos, vlogging, and also for photography.This was my first time using it, and I got amazing pictures right off the bat. My love for photography is rekindled, with no stress added!The camera uses AI for the autofocus and automatically blurs the background and focuses on subjects in your frame. That was important to me because I take a lot of close up pictures .The kit lens is taking amazing photos and is good for close up photography. I thought (after watching numerous YouTube videos) that the kit lens was ‚Äútrash‚Äù and I‚Äôd need to immediately buy another lens but I am pleasantly surprised on the quality of pictures I‚Äôm getting from it!All of the different modes are easy to use and fun to experiment with.The colors on the camera are amazing and it‚Äôs easy to transfer the pictures to your phone via Bluetooth.You will need to buy an SD card right Away, and I also purchased a screen protector so I don‚Äôt worry about touching the screen.It was definitely worth the I vestment for me and a huge upgrade from my smartphone.",

I did weeks of research to see what camera I wanted for the specs I was looking for. I mainly wanted something decently good in low light and something for mainly portrait photography and this fits both. It's extremely light weight (also depends on your lens- but I opted for a 50mm), controls are easy enough to understand plus you just gotta play around with it till your comfortable. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it to people wanting to dip their toes into photography",

The lens is so-so that comes with the boxed kit, it is OK but doesn't excel but is a decent lens to get acquainted to the camera with. Look to expand your lens collection bade Don your needs, but the body of the camera is very compact compared to traditional DSLR body sizes.The shotgun mic is pretty decent for a beginner but will likely be forgotten once a user grows their ability. Same with the grip, other options will likely be better platforms as someone is more comfortable with the camera and needs to expand to meet their needs.Extra batteries will likely be a requirement or otherwise look into compact filming platform battery systems.",

      "reviewTitle": "Great Watch and Upgrade - you will not miss your Fossil Gen 6, or any other",
      "reviewDescription": "This is a fantastic watch.  I've been a long-time Fossil smartwatch user.  My Fossil Gen 6 watch started acting up, and I recently learned that Fossil has exited smartwatches.  Once I switched to the Pixel 3, I was thrilled and do not miss my Gen 6 at all.  I should have switched sooner.My 2nd Fossil replacement alternative was the OnePlus 2.  The Pixel looked better (to me) and has Wear OS 5 which is the most recent version.  It was hard to decide between the two using online descriptions and reviews, but I am happy with my choice.  The Pixel battery life is better than the Fossil, even with the always on display, and easily gets me though the day.  The charge may not last as long as the OnePlus 2, but I do not wear it overnight and instead put the watch on the charger, so the extra battery life is not an issue for me.  Others may see this differently.The Pixel 3 screen is MUCH brighter and sharper than the Fossil, the processor is faster, and the watch operation is intuitive and easy to learn.  Activating the watch, setting it up, and switching from the Fossil was quick and easy since most of the apps and info are tied to my Google account.Long-time irritants with the Fossil were how the end of the watch band kept flopping loose from its holder band, and how the crown button constantly activated when I sharply bent my wrist.  The Pixel fixes both of these issues.  The Pixel watch band is a bit tricky to attach at first (YouTube helps), but it works MUCH better than the Fossil and is more comfortable.  The Pixel has a nice feature where you can rotate the watch display 180 degrees (make it upside down) so you can wear the crown button on the left side of the watch.  No more accidental app activations, restarts, or 911 calls!My primary watch use is for business to monitor emails and texts, and to see/screen/take phone calls.  All these work beautifully, and are handled much better than with the Fossil.  Even the weather app is upgraded in the new OS, and there is a timer that can be added to the tiles.  I use my watch secondarily for the health features, and I was sad (at first) to learn Google Fit would not be on the Pixel.  I used Fit on the Fossil to track steps and distance walked.  The new FitBit basic version is a true upgrade and gives me all the info I had before, plus a lot more.  I did not opt for the free Premium FitBit trial.I bought and recommend a set of the plastic watch covers for scratch and impact protection, and a charging stand.  Both work great.",

      "reviewDescription": "I purchased this watch used like new and it looks like the person just received it and sent it right back.  It isn't like new, it is new and works great!!  The battery life compared to both my pixel 1 watch as well as my galaxy 7 watch is superior!!  It's the 45mm version which I think fits my wrist well.  I have an 8 inch wrist so I'm using the provided large strap, as the pixel 3 watch comes with a regular strap and a large strap right in the box.  The charger has improvements compared to the pixel 1 and also charges up a lot faster.  I use my desktop PC to charge my watch and it takes about forty minutes to charge fully.  The watch is very light weight compared to the pixel 1 and it also has some extra features.  Well worth the purchase.  And I saved app eighty dollars buying a used like new watch.",

      "reviewDescription": "This watch is just what I was looking for, as it looks beautiful, the band is sleek and extremely comfortable, and the watch face is streamlined; plus there are many watch faces to choose from whenever you feel like it; it isn't too heavy, it's accurate, I feel that it is a good value for the money, the connection is appreciated, it does need to be charged frequently but that's the only downside (in my case once a day on average but does charge quickly). I chose this particular watch because of the added safeguards; it has fall detect (I got diagnosed with P.O.T.S so there is always a chance that I could pass out) ECG whenever my heart seems to be acting weird for added peace of mind, crash detect which is always a nice bonus, I have  had a FITBIT for over 10 years (not the same one:) ) and I have found that all in all they are great watches and I really like the FITBIT app; so this time I thought that I would try GOOGLE and I am glad that I did.",

      "reviewTitle": "The ADHD helper",
      "reviewDescription": "First impression review:I made the decision to buy this for one seemingly dumb reason: my Garmin Venu2s doesn't have sound. Vibration only. So I was missing just about every reminder I set for myself. I really didn't realize the vast difference in capability between the Venu2s and this device until I bought the Pixel Watch 3.I'm about three days in and I'll tell you this. If you are diligent and thoughtful about how you use this device, and willing to read a lot of old reddit posts, it can be a real game changer for planning around ADHD. But you have to put in some effort to get everything tweaked and planned because it's not perfect right out of the gate.First: reminders and tasks. The Pixel 3 does have sound, but like the Pixel phone it can't be tweaked to only have sound for reminders as opposed to other notifications. Also, its vibration is weak, worse than Venu2s. I got around this by installing an app called Wear Notification Helper that allows you to set custom tones and vibration patterns for different apps. Game changer. You have to install it on both your phone and watch and program it from your phone. Now my reminders come through as a strong three second vibration and a chime with all other notifications muted.Note: For reasons that are baffling, there is no Wear OS app for Google Tasks. I found the best WearOS app for tasks is ToDoist. If you want Google reminders from your phone to show up on your watch, you have to install Google Tasks on your phone. This is a huge oversight IMO. I highly recommend ToDoist. It has a lot of functionality compared to other task apps.Calendar: the only calendar I have found that can integrate the Google Calendar with say, Outlook, is called Business Calendar 2. It's great. You can customize the colors and it has some tiles where you can see your day at a glance as a fully integrated calendar. It will even show your Google Tasks on your calendar. Google Calendar will not integrate with Outlook on WearOS so you need that third party app. Another oversight.Final two complaints - battery life for the smaller version does kind of suck. Expect to charge it every day. I would have bought the bigger version but only the small one came with a pink strap. I freaking love that pink.Now for the unequivocally good: The Google Assistant is my new best friend. For privacy reasons, I don't care for the voice activation cue so I use the side button on the device to summon it. I have been setting reminders and alarms like gangbusters. Reminders for everything - do the laundry, give the kid a bath, pack the kid's lunch, send my boss that work thing on Monday, don't forget to pick up Y thing from daycare (scheduled to notify me right when I arrive to daycare.) The effect has been gosh darned miraculous. I usually forget things all the time, but lately I don't forget things. No matter where I am, at any time, I can verbally set a reminder for something using Assistant or use ToDoist to make it into a task. This is changing my life. I no longer have to try to hold all this stuff in my head.There are two incredibly fun features of this watch - the first is voice to text, which works really well and is a joy to use to blather nonsense at my husband via SMS. I can even see his dumb GIFs! The other is the sheer amount of customization of the watch face, both for style and function. You can have so many shortcuts to all your favorite apps and functions and the default watch faces have so many customizations and color options. My watch face has 8 complications/shortcuts and is bubble gum pink. The tiles offer additional customization for shortcuts to your favorite apps. And of course there are more items options in the Play store. It really seems that your experience of this watch is what you want to make of it. I happen to be using it to compensate for the shortcomings in my executive function, but maybe you want music and podcasts, or the ultimate fitness device. I really think it can be so many different things.I'm still breaking into to the Fitbit stuff, but it seems great. I like the reminders to move. There also appears to be a wellness and mental health component. If you are a serious athlete, to be frank, you're probably not going to do better than Garmin. But I can barely walk these days, so it's good for me.Yet to test: Spotify, GPS, actual phone calls. I will update.",

      "reviewDescription": "10/10 sound quality10/10 noise cancellation10/10 comfortability10/10 durabilityThe sound quality surpassed my expectations when watching shows or listening to music. Everything is crispy and clear! Noise cancellation is great, but do keep in mind that if the environment is really loud, you may still hear a bit of it through the headphones. It doesn't bug me too much and helps brings some peace and quiet when necessary. When first receiving the headphones, wearing them cause a bit of soreness cuz I felt like my head was being squished. After wearing them for long periods of time, you kind of break them in and they will become more comfortable that you don't even notice them. Prior to owning the AirPods Max, I owned that AirPods Pros and they were uncomfortable after a few hours of wears. When comparing the two, the Max is definitely the best overall. Every single day I'll pack them in my bag for work and they've held up! Durability is definitely there, and tbh there's really no need to purchase an extra case since it gets really bulky. I had purchased a case only to never use it unless I feel like it's necessary to be used.Its worth the investment!",

      "reviewDescription": "I had a pair of the Bose quite comfort that I used for years. These sound much better and the build quality is amazing. Price is high but they are a quality pair of headphones that integrate  perfectly with a Mac desktop, iPad and iPhone. The instrument separation when listening to music is much better than the Bose. I have not used them on a flight yet but the noise canceling works really well. I use them everyday for hours while working and plug them in at night. After a full day of use they only use 30% of the battery.  I am glad I bought them.",

The Apple AirPod Max are the best, in terms of clarity and soundstage, I've tried so far.  I also owned a pair of Sennheiser HD 800s - these are wired, but the AirPod Max is the only wireless headphone had even approaches the HD 800 in audio soundstage and overall quality.  To note, I do use Apple Music, so I'm sure this only adds to why the AirPod Max's sound so good.The Max's are a bit hefty, but by design, are well balanced - the result is a solid headphone is quite comfortable (I've worn them on a 9 hour flight with no issues).I have to admit that when the return window came, I found that I couldn't live without these.",

The poor quality headband and ‚Äúcondensation gate‚Äù issue should be a dealbreaker enough to pass on these headphones entirely. They are not worth your consideration. The sound quality, ANC, and transparency features are great, but there are critical design flaws that simply cannot be ignored at that $500+ price point.Google ‚Äúcondensation gate‚Äù and you will understand why these headphones don‚Äôt deserve your hard earned money. Moisture and electronics doesn‚Äôt mix. Why on earth would you waste money on a product that has a high likelihood of shorting out soon after the warranty expires?The headband. I can‚Äôt even believe they poorly designed such a critical piece of the product. The headband‚Äôs support system is made out of (wait for it) MESH!!!!! Think about that folks. All that‚Äôs keeping the metal frame of the headphones from painfully resting DIRECTLY on your head is a very thin layer of mesh of which over time begins to sag, and when it does, the consumer instantly goes from having pain in their wallet, to pain on their head as well. I cannot for the life of me understand why they would have designed the headband with such a flimsy support system.Comfort is a serious issue as well. The clamping force coupled with the sheer weight of the headphones is straight up ridiculous. I do not recommend these headphones at all.  Not to mention the returns process is PAINFUL. I can only imagine that Apple makes it that way to discourage returns in general for products purchased through AMZ. You could potentially have to wait up to 30 days to get a refund due to Apple‚Äôs requirements to return this particular product.",

      "reviewDescription": "Bought this camera for a simple camera to use while traveling when I didn't want to take my huge Panasonic camera but still wanted a camera that wasn't on my phone, for safety purposes and also the anxiety of possibly losing or dropping my phone (either off high places, overboard, etc.). Many people say that it isn't worth it, and with the development of quality in phone cameras, why even bother buying a digital one that provides less quality photos than that of your phone, that almost everyone has and carries with them at all times? I personally like having a compact, portable camera that is less of an investment than an expensive smart phone in the case it gets stolen, dropped, damaged, etc. This in itself is an appeal for me to purchase a digital camera to use instead of my iPhone. It was a great alternative to my phone, allowing me to keep my phone tucked away in a pocket or a bag, while still being able to take photographs while on my trips. I really liked the red color offered, as I try to buy everything red. The camera itself is compact and portable, it was super easy to conceal and travel with, adding little weight to my travel bags. The camera is very easy to use, allowing different shooting settings, zoom, and even video recordings. The battery lasts quite a while too, but I bought secondary batteries just in case. I also really appreciate the fact the camera utilizes a rechargeable battery, so you can charge it on trips when you have a break and you don't have to be constantly carrying a set of AAs. The picture quality itself is high, in my personal opinion, really good for the price that you're paying and the compactness of the camera. The video quality could be better, but is decent for the size and price of the camera. If you're zooming in a lot, the video quality is obviously compensated, and the audio quality in videos isn't the best, but. You get what you pay for, and in this case, you actually get better. It's well worth the money, providing video-recording abilities and high quality photographs. I highly recommend this camera for anybody looking for a camera for the same purposes as I. It's well worth the money and has exceeded my expectations in performance. It would also be a great starter camera for someone looking for a simple point-and-shoot camera, or for adolescents looking to get into the camera/photography community. Obviously if you're a professional photographer, I wouldn't recommend this camera, but I doubt anybody professional is looking to take high-quality, professional photographs with a simple point-and-shoot camera. For the price, quality, and performance, this camera is well worth the money, and I highly recommend it!(:",

      "reviewDescription": "This is one of the reasons why.No one makes point and shoot cameras any more.A group called JKImaging took up the torch and licensed the Kodak name, and contacted the manufacturers who made the Kodak cameras and struck a deal. They were making Japanese name brand cameras under license as well.I wanted a pocket point and shoot I could stuff in a pocket and take for a bike ride. I have a lot of cameras but wasn't about to pack them up on a bouncy mountain bike.I tried a couple others but they just didn't fit the bill. So let's look for a brand name with a reputation.No Nikons. No Canons. No Fujis. Let's try KodakThis thing is loaded with features, has a good lens and a more than adequate sensor. Auto mode is really good, program mode is very good, and manual is everything you want.The others washed out on telephoto photos, low-light photos. and landscapes. They were good for close up snapshots, and had good features, but I wanted more.For $100 I got it.For serious photos it's not going to replace my Nikons or my Fujis, but far more than adequate to stuff in a pocket and go. Beginners can use Auto or Program and get good shots, and as they learn more can go to Manual and set whatever they want.My one complaint is the preview in Manual doesn't give an adequate representation of the resulting photo. Ten years ago i had a pocket Olympus that would. Except for that one detail, this is as good as that, and I took some great photos with that camera.The photos are unretouched except for resizing. All straight from the camera. One is Auto, One is Program, and the others are Manual.I'm a \"Semi-Amateur\" photographer. I take photos mostly for my own gratification, but I've had Galleries, sold a few, and a few that were published. I know what I want my photos to look like, and I can get it with this camera. Sometimes the definition isn't as good as my DSLRs, but then, I didn't pay 30 times what this cost.Very good little camera.",

      "reviewDescription": "This camera produces good quality pictures and overall gets the job done! The pictures come out pretty nice and give that exact smooth Pinterest digital camera picture. You can also include the time+date stamp at the bottom! It‚Äôs easy to use and perfect for beginners. Despite this its battery life is a little meh. But if you turn it off when not in use you‚Äôll be fine. Additionally, you have to hold the camera super still or else your pictures can come out blurry. It processes pretty slow too (like 2-3 seconds) but it‚Äôs not a big deal. It also makes sound when you turn it on and off as well as when you take a picture which can be a little awkward. Good and affordable option for a digital camera.",

This was a simple process as the silicone band is not attached when it arrives. Pairing the watch with my iPhone was a breeze, making it easy to use right out of the box. I was amazed at how much activity I was missing on my phone, which this watch brought to my attention. It has prompted me to adjust the notification settings on many of my apps, allowing me to stay informed without getting overwhelmed.Solid choice that is budget friendly.",

      "reviewTitle": "Nice entry level smartwatch",
      "reviewDescription": "It's got all the features you'd expect from a $30-$40 smartwatch, but with the addition of Alexa. And while Alexa does work, unfortunately the performance is lacking. I find myself going over to the nearest Echo and using Alexa the default way instead of messing with the watch. Maybe it's my phone that's too slow, I don't know.The rest of the interface is par for the course. Not bad, not great. There's one button that opens a lengthy menu that is a pain to navigate until you really get used to it. I wish it looped around as your flicking it up and down, but it doesn't. It does remember where you left it for next time though, which is usually nice but again, you need to be used to it. Swiping requires a full-screen motion of the finger, or else it probably won't work.I like that you can set alarms and timers directly on the watch. There is a handy quick-tools menu accessible by swiping down on the default screen which offers shortcuts to some of the menu options like settings and alarms, but some options aren't available elsewhere, like the flashlight and do not disturb. Until you're really familiar with it, it's hard to remember which options are in the quick menu (swipe down) and which are in the full menu (press button). The quick menu is unfortunately not customizable. I would much rather have a timer option there instead of the alarms.The speaker is decently loud and it vibrates as well of course, both settings are adjustable. The screen looks nice and reaches a reasonable brightness. I normally only look at my watch indoors so I keep the brightness at the minimum (20%) which is actually too bright for my liking but not worth complaining about. I don't notice any backlight leakage, yet, and I'll try to update this if/when that appears (it's common which cheap smartwatches as they age--one of the corners will turn a burnt orange color)The band is very comfortable and flexible, and I really like how the excess strap tucks inside and lays against your wrist. After the first full day of use I noticed some weird waxy coating starting to flake off in places. It was inconsistent though, it wasn't all over, so I don't know what that was about. A quick wash in warm water had it looking like new again. I'm glad I like the band, because when I ordered this I was hopeful it would fit the band from my old smartwatch, but it did not. The width of the mounting zone on this watch is about 2.5mm more than the other one, which is enough to make me not even want to try my other band with it. Oh well.The app it uses is VeryFit, which is no surprise for a watch in this price range. I really don't like the app, but after setup there isn't much use for it. I don't use it for sleep tracking or fitness...if you do, you need to get really familiar with the app. I just need notifications, timers and alarms for keeping me on task, and so far I'm happy with it. I give it a solid 4 stars.",

      "reviewDescription": "VeryFit Smart WatchSo the app you need for this is called the VeryFit app, and the watch has a helpful QR code on one of the opening screens so you can find it easily.  It's a free app.This is definitely like a FitBit - It's an exercise thing.  But improved, because it has weather, alarm, blood glucose level, and all kinds of other things.It came with clear instructions and, after a full charge, worked out of the box.  I love the screen size.  Any bigger would be bulky, but any smaller and I couldn't read it.  So pretty much perfect.It was listed at 30ish bucks when I received it - Now listed at 70ish.Alexa is built in, but I will never use Alexa so I just removed that from the home screen.My only complaint is that it won't work with Spotify.  I would like to use it as a speaker so that I can hit play on m Spotify from it, and have the sound come out of it or my earphones.  That part is a pretty big disappointment.",

      "reviewDescription": "I've had the watch for a solid 2 weeks and I have notes!Pros: the battery life is amazing. I've only charged it 2 times i wear it everyday all day.It's able to find my phone and I love that feature. I love the size of the watch. It's a great value for your money and it looks and functions really well. There are a ton of neat features like 02 tracking (but I'm not sure how accurate it is), but it's cool nonetheless. You can also customize the face and add your own pictures if you want to.Cons: you really can't track your workouts. If I go to the gym and lift weights there's no way of tracking that workout and if there is I haven't found it. You also cannot start text messages, you can reply but only with preset messages, but this really isn't a problem for me. Lastly it charges kind of slow, but since the battery lasts forever I feel like it gets a pass.",

      "reviewDescription": "I bought this watch since my dietician suggested I keep track and try to set a daily goal of steps taken daily  since I didn't really want or need much else, I wanted to spend less money than on a Fitbit. This fit the bill, does what I want, and is pretty simple to use. The watchface is pretty large, but I think you can tell that in the listing.I will say the directions that came in the box has quite a small font- but I downloaded a copy off the internet and could magnify them.The setup and use was pretty easy to get used to and the battery life seems to last quite a while between charging. I have not had to charge it the second time and have only had it a week and it is still at 71%.You can choose a background for the home screen (which is the actual time face) and I think it's cute!The band is a bit like rubber/plastic, a bit stiff, but soft. Seems to need a bit of breaking in for pliability. I cannot imagine wantinh to wear it to bed, but it says it has \"sleep tracking\".So to me, this piece works for what I want it to do, for a valid price point, and doesn't look too bad!",

      "reviewDescription": "Eh I mean it's a cheap fitness watch. Haven't used it much other than for steps, sleep, and the time. Using it for notifications is a pain. For snapchat as an example, it just constantly gives an updating notification every 10 minutes so basically doesn't give you notifications for that and can make it very easy to start ignoring notifications.But that battery! If you aren't using it for much other than a watch it will last for basically a week or more without needing charged. It has an insane battery life.",

      "reviewTitle": "Great value headphones that look nice and hold a charge!",
      "reviewDescription": "I purchased a set of these headphones for my husband a little over a year ago after he complained that the in-ear, ear buds were making his ears really uncomfortable. I have been an avid air pod user myself but has not been impressed lately with how long the charge lasts on my air pods. I decided to purchase these headphones for myself after my husband raved about them and I have to say - I am impressed. They are really easy to set up and pair with your devices and they work really well. The sound quality is great, and while I wasn't sure about switching from ear buds to the \"over the ear\" style headphones, I don't think I will ever go back. These are so comfortable with the cushioning on the ear covers and adjustable head piece. They charge quickly and seem to hold the charge which is the exact reason that I made this purchase! And the rose gold color looks really sharp!",

      "reviewTitle": "Multiple Device Connectivity Issues",
      "reviewDescription": "Overall, these headphones are great! I was looking for a cheap substitute for my husband‚Äôs beats for my own use. They aren‚Äôt completely noise cancelling (and I didn‚Äôt expect them to be) but they sound great, have a super long battery life and are a great deal for the money. However, there are two issues.1. Powering them off. It takes a long time to power them off (around 10 seconds) so it‚Äôs kind of annoying to have to hold the button down for so long. After having them for a couple weeks (I always powered them off when I wasn‚Äôt wearing them so I didn‚Äôt notice this at first) I realized it says ‚Äúpowering off‚Äù when you‚Äôve held down the button for the magical length of time.2. And this is a big one. I almost rated them three stars for this. You can connect them to multiple devices, which is great. If you‚Äôre listening on your phone and then want to switch to your computer, awesome. But the operative word is *want*. Unless I turn the Bluetooth off every device I don‚Äôt want the headphones to connect to, the headphones will arbitrarily decide which device they should be connected to. This is incredibly frustrating. And it‚Äôs fine as long as no one is watching the TV. Since I‚Äôve connected to the TV in the past, if my headphones are on, they‚Äôll connect to the TV. Even if another pair of Bluetooth headphones are connected to the TV, these headphones will kick them off and connect. This means I cannot use my own headphones to work on my computer if someone‚Äôs watching TV.Otherwise, the headphones are great. I love the color, they‚Äôre comfortable and they‚Äôre great for twenty bucks. But if the Bluetooth connectivity is going to really bug you, maybe this pair isn‚Äôt for you.",

      "reviewTitle": "Great Sound and Comfortable Fit - Excellent Wireless Headphones!",
      "reviewDescription": "I recently purchased the Glynz Bluetooth Wireless Headphones, and I've been really impressed with their overall performance and value. Setting them up was a breeze ‚Äì the Bluetooth pairing process was quick and seamless with my phone and tablet. I was listening to my favorite music within seconds!The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price. The audio is clear and well-balanced, with a decent amount of bass that doesn't overpower the other frequencies. Whether I'm listening to music, podcasts, or taking calls, the sound is crisp and enjoyable.Comfort is also a major plus with these headphones. The earcups are nicely padded and fit comfortably over my ears without feeling too tight or causing discomfort during longer listening sessions. The adjustable headband allows for a customized fit, which is great. They feel secure and stay in place even when I'm moving around.The battery life on these headphones has been fantastic. I've been able to use them for several hours on a single charge, and they seem to hold their charge well when not in use. The included charging cable is convenient, and it doesn't take too long to fully recharge them.Another feature I appreciate is the built-in microphone for taking calls. The call quality has been clear on both ends, and I haven't had any issues with people hearing me. The controls on the headphones are also easy to access and use for adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and answering calls.While I haven't used them for intense workouts, they seem sturdy enough for everyday use and light exercise. They feel well-built and like they will hold up over time.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase of the Glynz Bluetooth Wireless Headphones. They offer a great combination of sound quality, comfort, long battery life, and ease of use, all at a very reasonable price. If you're looking for a reliable and affordable pair of wireless headphones for everyday listening, I would definitely recommend giving these a try. They are a fantastic option!",

      "reviewDescription": "The Canon R6 Mark II is my second purchase of this incredible camera model, and I absolutely love it. As a professional photographer, I‚Äôve used a wide range of cameras over the years, and the R6 Mark II stands out as one of the best for capturing stunning photos with ease and precision.One of the most impressive features of this camera is its focus tracking. It‚Äôs nothing short of amazing how accurately and quickly it locks onto subjects, even those in motion. Whether I‚Äôm photographing wildlife, sports, or portraits, the focus tracking never fails to deliver sharp and clear images. This capability has elevated my photography to a whole new level, allowing me to capture moments with incredible detail and clarity.The R6 Mark II also offers excellent low-light performance, thanks to its high ISO sensitivity and advanced image stabilization. I‚Äôve been able to shoot in challenging lighting conditions without compromising image quality, which is a huge plus for anyone who loves shooting at night or indoors.Additionally, the camera‚Äôs ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold and easy to operate, even during long shooting sessions. The menu system is intuitive, and the touchscreen display is a pleasure to use.Overall, the Canon R6 Mark II has exceeded my expectations in every way. It‚Äôs a reliable, high-performance camera that‚Äôs perfect for both amateur and professional photographers alike. Whether you‚Äôre upgrading from another model or looking for a powerful camera to start your photography journey, the R6 Mark II is a fantastic choice that won‚Äôt disappoint.",

      "reviewDescription": "9 years in photography, mostly weddings and portraits and graduation. I shot with a 5D Mark IV for the last 6-7 years. It's a great camera but when mirrorless technology came I wanted to move forward eventually. However Canon wasn't nearly stepping up until the past two years.The R5 was a little out of my budget and EOS-R had only one SD card slot (wtf Canon, one slot?!). The R6 Mark 2 fit between the two. The original R6 lacked a decent amount of megapixels but when the R6 Mark 2 released, with the nearly 25MP I was content with that.I finally took this one out to a few events and a few portrait shoots.Pros:-Face detection, pet detection, vehicle detection, all types of detection for AF.-Extremely fast shooting speeds (great for sports photography)- 6K video and long filming times (longer than my 5D MK4)-Great low light performance, outshines my 5D-Numerous extra features which make taking photos so much more pleasantCons:-AF can get confused sometimes (I was at an event and it was wanting to focus on a flag on the wall even with People AF selected, huh?).-Not the camera, but CANON PLEASE LET 3RD PARTY COMPANIES MAKE RF LENSES",

Low light is really worth the upgrade.The battery lasts a long while, but I do wish they would by default include a spare.The build quality is really solid, it feels a bit more rugged than the R50 but maybe that's just because it's a good bit thicker.As far as I've seen, there are lots more settings than the R50, of course because it has way more functions available, but the touch screen seems to work the same on both.I would recommend getting a screen protector, and I plan to look at what other accessories are available",

      "reviewDescription": "I recently purchased the Upgrade Digital Camera, and I couldn't be happier with my decision! This camera boasts an impressive 56MP resolution and 1080P video quality, making it perfect for capturing vibrant and clear images. The 16x zoom feature allows for stunning close-ups, while the anti-shake technology ensures that every shot is steady and sharp‚Äîideal for those candid moments with my family.One of the main reasons I chose this camera is to encourage my son to enjoy photography without the distractions of the internet. Using my phone for pictures was convenient, but it often led to too much screen time. With this compact camera in dark blue, he can take photos without constant notifications pulling him away from the experience. The included 32GB TF card provides plenty of storage for all his creative explorations!Furthermore, the two batteries ensure that we never run out of power during our outings, and the included lanyard makes it easy to keep the camera close at hand. Overall, the Upgrade Digital Camera is an excellent choice for beginners looking for a user-friendly and fun way to engage with photography. Highly recommended!",

The 56MP resolution and 1080P video quality are breathtaking for a kids camera, with very clear pictures produced. The 16x zoom is a cool fun feature; the anti-shake also helps to keep images stable, good for little ones still learning how to take pictures. It came with a 32GB TF card and two batteries, so it has plenty of backup storage space for even longer use. The buttons are simple and easy to navigate: kids can start taking pictures right away without frustration. There's a nice lanyard attached and that's a cool thing, you can carry it without fear of dropping it. It's a good first camera for kids that love taking pictures and the pink color certainly adds to the fun.",

      "reviewDescription": "These things are crazy. I can hardly believe how long the battery lasts. I hadn't plugged them in for a few months and I turned them on and they were at 70%I've listened to them for probably 8 hours across two days and they are still at 70% they've dropped I think 10%Literally trying to bring their usage down to 30% so I can charge them before a flight haha.(batteries like being charged down to between 70-30% before getting charged to max to keep their longevity)-But seriously what a hilarious \"problem\" to have.-They are comfortable enough to wear all day.They're maybe not quite as dynamic as like a $300 set of Bose headphones.But they are very very good. Their sound is rich without being too bass heavyTheir range is great for probably 85% of people.Audiophiles may want to go into the soundcore app and mess with the Equalizer.I haven't had to mess with it and the \"default\" bass boost is actually just fine. (if just a tiny bit too bassy)-The fact there are like 70k+ reviews and the score is like 4.7 should be all you need to know.-The cans are big enough for most ears. Of course everyone's experience is different.-I've only had them for 6 months so I can't really attest to durability.People have said the cups wear out.Yea, salt, dirt, dust and oil degrade or eat through artificial leather.If you want them to last forever, slightly dampen a cloth with some eyeglass cleaner which is usually deionized water that will help wipe away sweat(salt) and oil from your skin. Hey no shame in it, we're all made from the same stardust. But these synthetic materials are going to be eaten by our skin sluff.If they made the cups out of real leather these would cost quite a bit more money so I don't mind that they kept the cost down. Just be sure to keep them clean especially with heavy daily use and you'll be good for year and years to come.Also of course keep them in their case when not in use and they shouldn't crack.-If you want to get real serious; you can use a few tiny drops of household multi-purpose oil. You can get a little tin of it on amazon for $4. These are indeed plastic. Plastic gets brittle over time, especially with salt/sweat pulling moisture out of the plastic. Wipe down the headset with a few dabs of oil once a month and that will keep the plastic supple and prevent it from cracking under normal usage.Honestly with those two tips these will last decades.A+ headphones Glad that Soundcore still cares about the majority of consumers who aren't willing to spend hundreds of dollars to get a quality product.",

      "reviewDescription": "Have had these headphones since 2022.  They produced fairly good sound for the price point while being comfortable.  Battery life for me was excellent, about 6-8 hours of continuous use and a bit more when used sporadically, felt like the battery lasted for weeks on end and would recharge between uses.  Bluetooth connectivity has always been spot on.  I've used them mostly with my LG G1 as well as with my previous Samsung TV.The only issue I encountered, which now makes them less useful, are the headphone joints have basically crumbled.  They began to crack at the end of the arch on each side after 2 years and now one of the joints basically fell off.  Other than epoxy or melting the arch to the joint together i cant think of another way to make any fix durable.",

      "reviewDescription": "Edit: Customer support was able to help me get these replaced, and the replacement doesn't have this problem, so I'm updating my review to reflect that. I'm hoping it doesn't just reoccur with this new pair but we shall see. Nonetheless, I appreciate Anker for helping get the problem corrected!I initially really liked these, but a few months in I ran into a problem where the plastic bend that connects the two ear cups together make a \"creaking\" noise whenever I make even the slightest head movement. The noise is annoying enough to ruin the experience for me. I didn't see anyone else talk about this, so I assume I just got unlucky rather than it being an actual design issue - in the end though, I have the pair that I have. They're just expensive enough that I wasn't willing to buy a whole new pair and risk have it happening again.Before that happened, I enjoyed these headphones - the battery life is great, the sound quality and ANC works very well, and I'd say they were pretty comfortable.",

      "reviewDescription": "These are great headphones! I love the different levels of noise cancellation.  They have good quality sound.  They are super comfortable, lightweight but sturdy. I can wear my glasses and these headphones and they don't bother me at all.  Usually that kind of thing would give me a headache. Pairing was very easy with my android phone.  Charge lasts a very long time.  They come with a nice case, charging cord and a jack/cord to plug into audio output if you ever need it.  I really don't have a single complaint.  I guess I should say I'm no audiophile, so I don't have a professional opinion,  but for an average consumer these are fantastic.",

When I turn these headphones on and the noise canceling kicks in, I am in my own world! Great for studying! I love that I can change the setting when I need to be aware of my surroundings. My son has a pair, too. He loves them because he gets VERY easily distracted and is able to focus on his homework.",

Can't compete with my old beloved Aeropex, nor with my old Bose Soundsport, and listening to music doesn't offer that bass that I so enjoy.... but they work fine, sound ok, they do fit in and around my ears without falling off; they fit comfortably, the controls for volume etc are easy to access, they charge quickly and stay charged for a long time...  and the handy little hard charging case is something I really do like.  Overall, these are a pretty good set, can't really complain if your'e not used to a fave higher quality product! I'm a year in, using these.",

Earbuds charging case has a built-in display, which makes it so easy to check the battery status at a glance. Speaking of battery life, the 48-hour playback time is absolutely incredible perfect for long trips, workouts, or just everyday use without constantly worrying about recharging. The sound quality is phenomenal. The over-ear hooks are a thoughtful design feature, ensuring a snug and secure fit. Even during my most intense workouts, I never have to worry about them falling out. They're also surprisingly comfortable to wear for extended periods. The built-in mic is another highlight; it delivers clear audio for calls, which is a must for my on-the-go lifestyle or when I'm in the car.",

      "reviewDescription": "I bought these bc I lost my other really nice ear buds. Theese are pretty comfy to wear even with my glasses on. The pairing was super simple. Took less than 1 minute to get paired. I got the task colored one bc I figured if it's bright enough hopefully I won't lose this dry like I did my last pair that was black lol. The sound quality is great too! Charges up pretty fast. Most earbuds are pricey but these are fairly decent price. Crossing fingers they last a long while!",

I positioned it on top of my monitor which is much more ergonomic, as the monitor and camera are directly in front of me - rather than my laptop‚Äôs camera, which is off to my right side. With at least 5 to 6 hours of Zoom calls a day, I probably should‚Äôve upgraded my camera and positioning years ago. I appreciate the privacy cover to close at the end of the day. Video quality is sharp and I‚Äôve been easily able to connect to this camera for all of my Zoom and Google Meet calls. I can‚Äôt comment on the audio quality as I use a separate headset for audio. No concerns with it so far‚Ä¶ I have only been using it for about three weeks so we shall see about the longevity, but I‚Äôm liking it so far!",

From the moment I set it up, the difference in video quality was crystal clear‚Äîliterally. The 1080p resolution is sharp, and the colors are vivid, making it perfect for Zoom meetings, webinars, and even casual video calls.What impressed me most is how smooth the auto-focus and light correction features are. Whether I‚Äôm in a brightly lit office or a dimly lit room, this webcam adjusts perfectly, ensuring I look my best in every situation. The microphone also delivers clear audio, eliminating the need for an external mic during most calls.The Zoom Certification is no gimmick‚Äîit genuinely enhances the experience. Integration with Zoom is seamless, and I noticed a significant improvement in video clarity compared to my previous webcam.Setup was effortless, and the included privacy shutter is a thoughtful touch, offering peace of mind when the camera isn‚Äôt in use.If you‚Äôre looking for a high-quality, reliable webcam for professional or personal use, the NexiGo Zoom Certified webcam is an excellent choice.

      "reviewDescription": "The first one I ordered was scrambling the image randomly, sometimes for 10 to 15 seconds and sometimes never stopped scrambling the image and I had to switch to my laptop camera and then immediately switch back to NexiGo webcam, and it would be fine.  Thinking that this was a hardware issue with the first one I received, I ordered a second piece, but it has the same issue of scrambling image randomly.  I would have given it a 2 star or 1 star for this, but when it works properly, image quality and sharpness at the edges of letters and numbers, even on small fonts on projected screen, is un-matched by any of the other 4 webcams of other brands that I ordered, to see if any of them matches the NexiGo. Unfortunately none of them did. Since there are no webcams in the price range I tried that comes even close to NexiGo's image quality, I am keeping the second piece and returning all the other 5 bad webcams. In the last few days I am noticing that even the 1 NexiGo webcam piece I have decided to keep, starts freezing the image randomly !!  and I have to switch to my laptop webcam and then immediately back to NexiGo webcam to get it to work properly again !!!!",

      "reviewDescription": "I've always been skeptical of how practical having an Apple Watch was considering I always have my phone on me. I purchased these for myself and my family on Christmas and it's been a great purchase so far. If you are on the fence for the reason I stated I recommend purchasing this product especially at this price. Battery life is good and it charges quickly, it's light and not bulky which is nice. It works as advertised and sharing the exercise circles with friends and family has led to a healthy exercise competition. Only complaint I have is the watch band is a little small, I think I only have maybe a slightly above average wrist size and the band only works at its biggest length. Luckily it's a perfect fit there but we had to order a new band for my brother because it was too tight.",

      "reviewDescription": "My husband bought this for me as a gift and I‚Äôm in love! It took me a few days to really understand it and learn all of the settings, but after a couple of months, I‚Äôm feeling more comfortable. So far, it‚Äôs as good as new and seems to be a decent size that I‚Äôm able to conceal under longer sleeves if I don‚Äôt want it hanging out. I really love it for the health factors though especially, such as tracking my sleeping patterns, fitness, and heart health. The only thing I would caution against is the battery life. I have to charge it in the morning when getting ready and before bed. But it‚Äôs held up well other than that.",

Product arrived quickly, packaged well, easy to follow setup instructions, no issues connecting it to their phones, all features work as they should. My daughter watches her heart rate & oxygen on it with some cardiac issues and my son loves tracking his steps during the day while walking around school. He also tracks his sleep for his doctor with a recent insomnia diagnosis this came in handy. Takes and holds a charge great, isn‚Äôt at all bulky, very functional and you can change the hands to match whatever your style might be that day.",

      "reviewDescription": "I bought this watch as a gift for someone, and they absolutely love it. We were choosing between this and the Series 10, which is more expensive, but this one had all the features we liked. The design is sleek and stylish, making it a great accessory for any occasion. Plus, it has everything from heart rate monitoring and GPS tracking to notifications and app integration. The user interface is easy to navigate, which makes for a seamless experience.The only downside was the delivery. The expected date kept changing, which was frustrating. I ordered it during a busy season, so I understand some delays, but changing the delivery date three times was a bit much. Despite this hiccup, the watch itself is fantastic and exceeded our expectations in terms of functionality and design. I highly recommend it, but just be prepared for possible shipping delays if you order during peak seasons.",

I bought these when they went on sale and got them for 15 bucks but even for the normal going rate of 20 dollars, these would be a steal. I think the sound quality is VERY nice, especially given the price range these fall into, and the stability in the ear is fantastic. Some earbuds fall out gradually over a listening session but I haven't had that issue even a little bit. Even when moving around a lot, these never moved. The ONLY gripe I would have about these is that the cord is a bit noisey. This really isn't noticable when music is playing, but it's worth mentioning that the cord is only so-so. Again this is my only gripe with these for the price so these are a great buy if you are considering them.",

      "reviewTitle": "Secure fit and good bass, but annoying microphonics",
      "reviewDescription": "HISTORYWhen I had to replace my long-time earbuds, I bought the DUNU Titan S after an analysis-paralysis level of research. The DUNU seemed well-built, but they were too tall and narrow for my outer ear canal and their unnatural music reproduction quickly fatigued my ears. Although I was able to return it for a full refund, I see that most sellers won't grant a full refund - especially for higher-priced buds. This is why I restarted my search at the lower end of the price spectrum in case I couldn't return future purchases. I purchased the KZ ZSN Pro. While it was wonderfully free of microphonics (see below), it was very similar to the DUNU in both fit and sound reproduction. Since it appeared that my ears are not a fit for Asian-designed ear buds ‚Äì ironic, since I'm Asian ‚Äì I next looked at domestic designs. After narrowing my search to JBL Endurance RUN (ER, henceforth) and Apple EarPods (EP, henceforth), I bought both for a comparison.WHICH DO I PREFER?‚ÄìFit: ERThe fit of EP is a mystery to me ‚Äì there are no tips to tailor the fit and its surface is slippery. Is my outer ear canal so different than those of the millions of EP users? For me, gravity keeps EP in my ears when I'm upright, but gravity pulls them out when I'm lying down. It doesn't fit in any useful sense. It just sits inside my ear. ER, on the other hand, comes with three sizes of grippy silicone tips and makes and keeps a solid contact with my ear canal. Chewing can sometimes loosen ER's fit ‚Äì if I'm being picky. I could buy hooks to give EP a better fit if I liked EP otherwise, but I don't. Fit is not just about comfort. Fit affects how the sound produced by the earbud drivers is delivered to our ear drums.‚ÄìSound: EREP lacks bass. That is mostly due to the driver and partially due to the fit. In higher-end IEM (in-ear monitors), tips are used to tailor the fit and, more importantly, to tailor bass. The ER's tips do change bass quality, with the smallest providing the leanest. ER's bass is not as deep or as accurate as my over-the-ear Sennheiser, but it is surprising and satisfying.‚ÄìMicrophonics: EPVibrations that reach our ear drums are converted by our brains into sound. These vibrations travel through solids, liquids, and gases (air). The more material that the vibration passes through, the more the vibration dissipates. This is how kids learned to tell whether a train was approaching by putting their ears on the train track. When an earbud cable rubs against our shirt or body part, the vibration that travels over the cable to the earbuds is known as microphonics. Wireless earbuds and over-the-ear headphones (insulation in their heavy cables restricts this vibration) have no to little microphonics. If an earbud cable has sufficient microphonics-cancelling material, however, it might be too bulky and the earbud might be prone to being pulled out of your ear with the weight and/or stiffness of the cable. (The KZ ZSN Pro compensates for its stiffness/bulk by having a preformed loop to secure it over your ears.) With budget earbuds like EP and ER, it's a matter of how much microphonics. In this comparison, EP is 50% quieter than ER. I found that wrapping ER's cable once around my ear reduces microphonics dramatically, however. This works because most of the vibration is intercepted by the flesh of my outer ear and scalp before it can reach the earbud. While wrapping the cable was a nice science experiment, I don't rely on it because this arrangement eventually loosens the fit of the buds during the listening session. Finally, because of microphonics, I won't be doing any physical activity while wearing ER ‚Äì despite JBL's marketing claim.After the trial period, I kept the EP but now only use it with my phone because callers can hear me better through EP's microphone.",

      "reviewTitle": "The Sound Quality is Much Better than 4.5 Stars",
      "reviewDescription": "I can't believe the overall review on these earphones averages out to a 4.5. Maybe it's because athletes were expecting these to last forever, or have a tendency to do things that put a lot of stress on the cord, or it's ends, or they're getting tons of sweat or rain inside them.My perspective on these, I've probably tried at least 20 different corded earphones, and I'm talking premium name brands, plus the same with earbuds and headphones. I guess you'd say I'm always on a quest for the best, and sometimes for the lowest cost. For $20, I think these are the best.When I purchased these I wasn't expecting much. I've tried the JBL 110, JBL Live 100. For what they are, they're ok. I just did a side by side comparison with those, and these, playing specific songs I like, gave the best overall balance of tone, with much higher volume than those other JBL's, and enhanced dynamic presence on each song, as if I was hearing the song live in-concert. The drums and cymbals, the bass, the guitar, and the vocals, were all incredibly balanced, crystal clear with no distortion, incredibly present as if the band was right in front of me, and that was for studio recorded songs.I think one of the biggest problems with earphones achieving all the above, is partially related to how well they seat deeply in your ear, and remain that way. Most earphones don't achieve that but these do, and they do it extremely well.I had been thinking about these earphones for months, and kept talking myself out of buying them, due to the reviews for them only averaging out to 4.5, I typically won't buy anything on Amazon unless the review for it is over 4.5. Plus, I almost didn't buy these because I thought since they were for running, excercise and for active wear, that maybe the sound quality made certain sacrifices, compared to other JBL earphones. Not buying these would've been a huge mistake, they're not only the best sounding JBL earphones, they're the best earphones of any big name brand that I've ever tried, and I own some that cost way more than these. Now my plan is to order 2-3 more boxes of these, because JBL does have a tendency to stop making certain earphone models.As for the grade I gave this, I'm giving these a 5.0, because for $20, the sound is incredible, so incredible, I would've been willing to pay at least $50 for them, and still been happy with my purchase, the sound quality is that good. I've spent a lots of name brand earphones and this $20 pair puts an end to my earphone tone quest, I'm getting more of them as back-upsNow for the 4.5 reviews on here, and athletes or those that exercise and use these, I'm guessing with your phone in your pocket, and jumping up-and-down, twisting and turning, and putting stress on the ends of the cord of these, and stretching it out too far, or getting the inside of the earphones contantly wet with sweat or rain, yeah maybe they do stop working after a while, so what, they're only $20. If I was an athlete and purchased these for $20, and was exercising daily, and stressing and pulling on the ends of the cord, and drowning the inside of them with sweat or rain, and they stopped working after a few months, I wouldn't care if I had to buy another pair every few months, the sound the provide is incredible for $20. Stop whinning, suck it up and buy another pair if you're abusing the cord everyday. And if you're looking for something with a lifetime gurantee that's indestructible no-matter-what, and sounds this good for $20, please let me know when you find it.So whether you exercise or not, I dare you try these and say the sound they provide isn't worth $20. And if you find a pair that does sound better for $20, please let me know.",

The fact that the company made the time and effort to follow up with me I view as a definite positive to the quality and dedication of the company to its product.I am giving the watch only a 4-star review because I have only been using the watch for 2 days. For that time, the various functions I have accessed have worked well and the accuracy of the measurements-heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen, steps, sleep, weather-was good so the information was meaningful. I am pleased with this purchase and will revisit this review once I explore more of the functions and give it some time to assess its durability.",

I installed and uninstalled the app several times.  Each time I had it scan for my watch it would show that it could not find it. When I asked for product support it set a window of several days to a week.  I finally gave up.  Nothing should be that much trouble!  It is a nice looking watch but not worth the aggravation.  It is going to be returned immediately.  I am just sorry I spent so much time bothering with it.  I would give it a big fat zero if possible!",

      "reviewDescription": "I recently purchased this camera to use in our camper, and it has exceeded all my expectations! One of the main reasons I bought this camera was to keep an eye on our dogs while we were away, and it has been fantastic for that purpose.The camera is small and compact, making it easy to place discreetly in our camper without taking up too much space. Despite its size, the video quality is excellent, and I can clearly see what our dogs are up to at all times.What I love most about this camera is that it works off cellular, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about losing connection if there‚Äôs a power outage. This feature gives me peace of mind, knowing that I can always check on our pets no matter what.Setting up the camera was a breeze, and the mobile app is user-friendly and reliable. The motion detection alerts are prompt, and the night vision is surprisingly good. It has truly been a game-changer for us during our camping trips.Overall, I highly recommend this camera for anyone looking for a reliable and compact camera to monitor their pets or property.",

      "reviewTitle": "Excellent Little Camera!",
      "reviewDescription": "I purchased this camera recently to add to my home security. It's honestly a great little camera for the price. The package came quickly and well packaged.  Setting up was extremely easy. As instructed, I charged the camera straight out of the box. While there was some charge initially, I thought it best to give it a full battery before connecting. It charges with a micro USB, a short one was included, I used a longer one I had left over from another device.  After gaining a charge, I followed the printed instructions. They were brief and easy to understand. I downloaded the Ubox app, and was presented with a QR code to scan with the camera. The camera operates on 2.4ghz, not the standard 5ghz of home wifi. I had to configure my Wi-Fi before connecting, and Bluetooth must be on on the device with the app. My service provider's wifi app allowed me to change frequency temporarily, specifically for device set up. Once I was in 2.4ghz, I held the QR code up to the camera. The camera beeped a few times and connected very quickly.  As soon as connected, the room appeared in crisp video in the app. I used SD rather than the available HD to conserve battery, and the picture is fantastically clear!  The camera is small and unobtrusive, making it easy to place. It comes with a stand you can mount, or it can be used freestanding. Positioning was easy, the real-time view in app made it simple to place.  The camera has an option for local storage with a micro SD, not included, I put one in for backup to be certain to back up video in case the app/cloud storage failed - it has not! Nice to know you have options though.  The app is easy to navigate and select your settings. Motion detection has several sensitivity levels to adjust for traffic in the room. I have received all notifications for motion and the clip length recorded can be set for 5, 10, or 20 seconds. Video is clear even in SD mode.  All in all, this camera is the best of the motley assortment I use for home monitoring. It seems well built, the picture is great, and the audio is clear. The app is intuitive and the motion sensor is reliable. I cannot recommend this little cam highly enough for your indoor needs!",

      "reviewDescription": "So far I really love this camera. More than the camera I hard wired into my car. With this camera you don‚Äôt need to connect to WiFi, which is what I needed for my car. And it provides live view, so I can quickly see what‚Äôs happening (my car was vandalized, so I this is added security). Its battery so far has last me two days.. possibly three days (I haven‚Äôt used all the battery yet). The video quality is great! Night mode too! Not too much lag (depending on the signal), easy setup. You do need to have your videos sent to cloud. They give you a 30 day trial.",

They improved the fit somewhat and they can get a bit louder than the last generation which was VERY good too.  Downloadable EQ app works well and allows personal sound customization.  These buds deserve 6 stars for the price.  Unbelievable.! My last pair are still going strong after 2 years and  I've used them about 300 times working out.  Still work fine but I had to try these.  They have excellent LOW adjustable  Bass with the EQ app. Mids and highs  are clear without distortion too.  Easy to set up.  TIme will tell but if they last like my last pair don't hesitate.  These TOZO A1's are a screaming bargain.!!!",

      "reviewDescription": "I bought a pair of these ear buds when I saw them on special for a great price.  I have been using them for about 4 or 5 months now and absolutely love them.  They have paired easily with a number of different devices, sound great with both audiobooks and music, and the battery life is superb.  Just turn on Bluetooth on your device(if not already on), take these out of their case, put them in your ears, connect, & go.  Nice to have something that works so well, so easily.  In fact, when I came back to the product page to write this review I saw they were on special I picked up another pair!",

      "reviewTitle": "Terrific Buy!",
      "reviewDescription": "I have been a big fan of Tozo products since my first purchase in 2021 of their T12 earbuds. Since then I have also purchased their T6, T10, T20, and now their A1 earbuds. While you can‚Äôt expect their sound to compete with high-end earbuds like Bose or Sony, I have always found that for the money you can‚Äôt beat Tozo‚Äôs earbuds. I purchased these A1 earbuds to use while listening to the TV at night. This has been my experience so far with this product:PROS:ÔÅÆ 1. Their small size and light weight make them the most comfortable of all the Tozo earbuds that I have tried.ÔÅÆ 2. The sound is very clear for listening to TV broadcasts and podcasts, where the ability to reproduce a lot of bass is not an issue.CONS:ÔÅÆ 1. The assortment of ear tips that come with these is not as extensive as with some of their other products, and I found that their largest size, which comes pre-installed, was a little smaller than I really needed. I could have used one size larger, which might have improved the bass response for me.ÔÅÆ 2. I had some issues with the sensitivity of the touch controls. With these earbuds you touch and hold the earbud to change the volume. I have found that they didn‚Äôt always respond. I wish Tozo would use one touch for volume rather than having to touch and hold, since I found that sometimes I would touch and hold the earbud to change the volume and if the earbud wouldn‚Äôt respond properly the earbud would turn off because I had held it too long. This hasn‚Äôt been a big problem for me with the TV because I can use the TV remote to change the volume. I hope that Tozo will read this review and look into it. It is possible that the pair I received might be defective.ÔÅÆ 3. If your primary use is going to be listening to music, I would recommend looking into one of Tozo‚Äôs other earbuds, since I did find bass to be a little lacking. These earbuds are more than adequate for listening to podcasts or TV, but for music I would recommend looking at one of their other excellent earbuds, such as their T6 earbuds, which I found to have very good sound quality and are still very comfortable, even though as far as I know they also use a 6mm speaker driver, same size as the A1. As you go up in the Tozo line you start to get bigger drivers (8mm for the T-10, and 10mm for the T12 and T20), so you may be more satisfied with music reproduction with those earbuds. However, there is a tradeoff, since accommodating those larger drivers can also results in a larger earbud. I found the T-6 to be a good compromise between sound quality and comfort.I want to stress, however, that even with some of the issues I had with these they have still become my earbuds of choice for my nighttime TV listening due to their clear voice reproduction and comfort. As is the case for all the Tozo products, they are really an incredible value, and it‚Äôs amazing to me that they can put out products this good at the prices they charge. I continue to be a big Tozo fan, and look forward to trying their future earbud products.",

      "reviewDescription": "The predecessor, Z6 II, was an exceptional camera to begin with. The video was acceptable, down-sampled 4K from 6K, it was sharp. The let down was the 8-bit 4:2:0 internal shooting. There wasn‚Äôt much latitude in post, so it wasn't a true enthusiasts hybrid camera. The Z6 II left shooters desiring a more videocentric camera. Now they have it here with the Z6 III, we‚Äôve got the same 24.5mp resolution which is plenty, and exceptional for low light photography and especially video. True Z6 enthusiast didn‚Äôt ask for higher resolution since the Z8 covers that. We got the low light and now we the video features with 6K/60p internal raw at full sensor readout, great waveform, line-in, RAW, ProRES, H.265 and H.264 codecs. Amazing. You got the image quality, now you have the video. This camera is a perfect companion to your Z8 or as it‚Äôs own platform. With Pixel-Shift, it‚Äôs got landscapes covered. It‚Äôs small, it‚Äôs light, and it packs a punch well above its price level. In fact, you cant get these specs in a camera less than $4000",

      "reviewDescription": "I have literally been buying these for over 10yrs. I don't even remember how I got the original pair, but they lasted a super long time just using them for music at school. I use them to sleep because the wireless ones are 1. expensive and 2. constantly get lost. the description says \"tangle free,\" which I realize now I've never had tangling be an issue. I get new ones about every 1/2 - 1 year.they will hold up for longer than you expect if you use them for normal use instead of sleeping on them every day like I do. the cord will probably develop an issue where you have to have it a certain way or one of the earbuds will go quiet. this doesn't really matter to me since I'm a side-sleeper and only use one anyways. it's also not a big deal at all if you're at a desk or something.I have Letshuoer S12 pro wired earbuds and wireless Galaxy Buds Pro 2. obviously these do not compare at all to them, however I'm not offended whenever I go from listening to music with the S12s to listening to random YouTube videos with these. the main issue I can see anyone having with these is that the cord noise can be distracting while you're moving around if you're not used to tuning it out. the sound is not insane, it's just really good for being $10. there is no tinny noise to me and I can see someone making them sound a lot better if you're into messing with audio settings. I would say they are very balanced in terms of sound, like they're not super bass-boosted or anything.while there may be better earbuds for music around the $20 price (Moondrop CHU II DSP), the combination of being extremely cheap (you won't cry when they break), lasting for long enough to not be annoying, having no notable annoyances while just listening to stuff, and how lightweight & comfortable they are makes me recommend them to everyone - ESPECIALLY if you're mainly listening to YouTube videos.",

      "reviewTitle": ">>> DOES THE JOB",
      "reviewDescription": "> MUSIC QUALITY ‚Äì The sound-quality of music using the Sony MDREX15LP is very good ‚Äì with typical earbud base.  That‚Äôs just a matter of physics, earbud drivers are simply to small to produce good base.  (\"Base boosted\" earbuds produce louder base (which smothers the high- and mid-tones), but \"loud\" (lacking any detail) is not the same thing as \"good\").  Suggestion, use the earbuds when you are out, but purchase a Sony ZX headphone set for listening to music at home -- and enjoy the base.> VOICE QUALITY ‚Äì Clean, clear and crisp in the voice-range, without fiddling with an equalizer ‚Äì largely because the base is poor.  So these (or similar) earbuds are clearly the choice for listening to audiobooks, podcasts, talking on your phone, etc.  Listening to music, with base-rich music, can be very enjoyable -- but Sony ZX headphones produce far better base than any brand of earbuds, at any price.> Loud vs efficient.  Sony MDREX15LP earbuds are very efficient --- the volume is loud at low volume settings -- not TOO loud, there is plenty of room for adjustment, but louder than many other earbuds and louder than most headsets, at the same volume settings.  Practically speaking, \"efficient\" means that the earbuds do not drain the battery on your battery-operated device as quickly.  \"Efficient\" is a good thing.  Also, if you pay attention, you can usually lower the volume, and the sound quality will be just as good -- and your battery will last longer.  Always play music at the lowest setting that you can hear well.  Or you can crank up the volume and plan on being deaf by the time you are 50 --- 40 if you use garbage \"base-boosted\" earbuds.> EXERCISE, ETC ‚Äì Stays in place better than most earbuds.  But, if you engage in strenuous exercise, consider Panasonic ErgoFit, which fit deeper in your ear.  The down side of the Panasonic ErgoFit is that they fit so securely that it is difficult to get them out of your ear quickly, to answer a phone, etc.> SYMMETRY ‚Äì The Sony MDREX15L are close to being bilaterally symmetrical ‚Äì It doesn‚Äôt really matter if you put the put the left earbud in your right ear, etc.  However, the Panasonic ErgoFit are not, they fit deeper into the ear, and are shaped differently to match your right and left ear canals.  It can take a while to get used to inserting the right Ergofit earbud into your right ear, and the left into the left.> ISOLATION ‚Äì All truly in-the-ear earbuds, with cup-shaped rubber cushions, are good at reducing outside noise, better than headphones ‚Äì often good enough for air travel (depending on the aircraft and the location of your seat).  Many earbud brands claim to feature ‚Äúnoise cancellation‚Äù but do not actually have any noise cancellation circuitry.  Passive isolation (such as provided by the Sony MDREX15LP earbuds), is NOT noise cancellation.  Feedback reduction (on wi-fi earbuds with microphones) is often called noise cancellation, but isn't.  Beware that while true noise cancellation works moderately well for aircraft engines (and similar sounds), it doesn‚Äôt work at all for screaming children or random noise.  If  your earbuds feel loose in your ear, you may need to install large cushions on the earbuds, to get them to seal in your ear canal good enough to provide good isolation.> COMFORT ‚Äì The secret to comfort when using earbuds is to use the smallest cushions which work for you.  Three sets, small, medium, and large are included with the Sony MDREX15LP earbuds. You might be most comfortable  with smaller cushions.  It a can also take a while to build up tolerance.  So, if earbuds hurt your ears, build up slowly wearing them a little longer each day.  It can take weeks to get to the point that you can wear them all day long without pain.  Changing, or replacing, earbud cushions is easy --  just pull the cushion off, and push the new one (or cleaned one) back on.> PLUG ‚Äì The plug is angled, at 90 degrees, unfortunately. If you pull on the cord, you won't easily pull the plug out the socket, but you will put on strain on the cord (where the cord attaches to the plug), and potential damage it.  In my experience, this is how most headphones fail.> PACKAGING ‚Äì The Sony MDREX15LP earbuds that I purchased came in wonderful frustration‚Äìfree packaging ‚Äî in a small plastic bag in a small easy-to-open cardboard box.  But, I can‚Äôt promise that you won‚Äôt get a horrible retail anti-theft pack.  Amzn used to promote and feature frustration-free packaging -- but, sadly, doesn't anymore.> SLEEPING ‚Äì The Sony MDREX15L don‚Äôt stick out as far as some other brands, and so, may be more comfortable when resting with your head to the side (or inside a helmet).  Panasonic ErgoFit fit deeper in the ear, and are a little more comfortable in such situations.  APTEK offers a nice earbud set for sleeping that is even smaller‚Äìbut the cushion is built-in, so you can‚Äôt choose the cushion size.  However, even with the APTEKs, I cannot comfortably sleep with an earbud in the ear that is on the pillow.  My solution ‚Äì I just use one earbud in the ear that is NOT on the pillow.  In fact, I recycle earbud sets where one earbud has failed, by cutting the failed earbud off, and using the working earbud, shifting the earbud from ear to ear if I change sides.> TIP ‚Äì CLEANING EARBUDS ‚Äì The build up of earwax is a serious problem.  It can actually muffle and distort or block the sound, and when it gets that bad, effective cleaning is difficult or impossible.  The best and simplest strategy is to take a look at your earbuds every few days, and vigorously scratch/flick the open hole of the cushion several times.  That breaks loose the wax into flakes, which you can then just blow away.  Wiping (such as with a Q-tip) doesn‚Äôt work so well (unless you take the cushions off, clean them, and reinstall  them), because wiping with a Q-tip may just grind wax into the little screen in front of the speakers, which is then impossible to clean.  Caveat, Sony MDREX15L earbud cup-cushions are a slightly different shape from other brands, with a smaller hole, and seems to collect less earwax -- even so, regularly checking and clearing earwax is a good thing to do.",

      "reviewDescription": "The Sony MDREX15AP In-Ear Earbuds are an affordable option for those looking for simple, no-frills wired earbuds. The sound quality is decent for the price, with clear mids and highs, though the bass is a bit lacking. The earbuds are lightweight and comfortable for extended use, but the build quality feels somewhat flimsy. The inline microphone is a nice addition for calls, but it picks up background noise easily. Overall, these are a solid choice for casual listening or as backup earbuds, but don't expect premium audio quality",

      "reviewDescription": "Setup with connecting to my phone was simple, you will get text message notifications if you are synced to your phone.  Compared to my previous smartwatch It's very lightweight given that there are no metal components, which was a plus for me.  It comes interchangable with the classic rubber wrist strap or Velcro wrist strap which is my personal favorite as removal and applying is simple and fast. Battery life is as expected with majority smart watches, very long while in use and on standby.  Many functions, from the basics such as heart rate, blood oxygen, step counter, weather , calculator, timer, and new for me the stress level reader also with a wide range of sports modes to choose from. Iv had this for a couple weeks now and have had no issues thus far even with the extreme heat, rain, and wind, it still works just as it did on day one. Other than the light weight weight and style comparisons, I don't see much of a difference between this smart watch and the more pricer ones. Overall worth the price and would really recommend.",

The quality is good and it‚Äôs easy to set up. I got spoiled with the bells and whistles of Eufy (AI tracking and more control over motion detection), but this is still a solid camera. It has a SIM already in it and so paying for the unlimited data and cloud storage each month is about $25/month. That‚Äôs average for any cellular camera.",

      "reviewDescription": "I didn't review this at first because it just works. It's affordable and it works. After about 4 months the camera started to intermittently not connect and I had a heck of a time pulling up recorded clips... If I can't review the clips or connect in real time what good is the camera? I actually have two of these and the one in the rear of my place always worked flawlessly. Both had great wifi connection. So, I figured I just bought a cheap camera and it worked for a short time and lesson learned. But, there's a button in the app for customer care. Wow. I just relayed the issue and before you know it the agent \"Deer\" was sending me a new camera. He didn't have me send the old one back and wait till it was recieved or anything you get from most places these days. It was out of the  Amazon return windrow, so I expected to be out of luck. It was just super quick old time good customer service. Now, I got the replacement, slapped it back in the same place as the original, and it works perfectly. And I still have the faulty one & I think I'm going to try to figure out why it was failing... I bet the wifi antenna is buggered. I'm impressed, the camera works well (no subscription with a microsd), great resolution, quick interaction over wifi and cell coverage from wherever, and awesome service!",

This camera is nice to have, it notifies me when there's movement and I can watch the clip it captured or go straight to live viewing. I have a trail camera, but it lacks mobility. Where as this one I can rotate all around.  I contacted customer service to inquire about an issue with my camera, to which was my own misunderstanding and not their or cameras fault. 'Deer' was the rep that aided me and resolved the issue immediately. Their team seems knowledgeable and ready to help, they even set me up with a 2 year warranty! They actively show that they want to build trust with their customer base, which is such a nice thing to come across. I would no doubt get more cameras from this company when I get my own house, I would recommend.",

      "reviewDescription": "I have remote property and have been trying a variety of trail cams for tracking the wildlife and providing a bit of security. They have all fallen short primarily due to the lack of actual live feeds that you can view and control. Even the highest rated name brands just don‚Äôt live up to the fact that this 2025 and we want to see with our system without getting $5‚Äôed and $10‚Äôed for every request.  But now I have found what I am looking for.  This system has it ALL.Easy installation, SD card slot, Simple activation, reasonable fees that are inclusive of everyday camera usage, cloud storage to boot, solar powered, and 100% completely controllable from your device. The app could stand a face lift and bit of user experience upgrades, but it gives you the controls you need to modify pretty much every detail of camera configuration, storage, and camera control, including pan, tilt and zoom. SD and HD image modes, even with live feeds. Pull photos through cell from the cameras card or their super fast cloud service if you pay a little extra.  Battery life is not an issue, the solar panels keep them topped off, even in the worst Texas weather.Better still the company cares about its customers. I had one camera that just was not responding well and was difficult to get images. They helped me trouble shoot it asynchronously via the app messaging system (Might be better if they used Business Messaging) and when that didn‚Äôt work promptly replaced the camera. I‚Äôm blown away by how well I have been treated.I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be buying more cameras soon and recommending them to all my neighbors. They are always impressed with the quality of images and simple access, even in the our mostly remote location.",

      "reviewDescription": "These are perfect for the Grandchildren to use when they come over.  Sound quality is okay for the price, but what I like the most is they are bendable so they won't break as easy.  Other regular headphones would always get broke one way or another.  These seem so much more durable than the headphones I was getting before.  I had enough headphones to keep some for here and send each child one home so they could use them for school.  They will not break easily being put in a backpack for school (and all the abuse a child's backpack takes in a single day).  Their school requires them to have headphones for school and we were buying new ones all the time because of breakage, but so far so good.  These have not broken.",

      "reviewDescription": "These cameras are surprisingly good for the price. The video quality is super sharp, and the pan/tilt feature is so helpful for checking the full room. I use one for watching my cat while I‚Äôm out and another as a basic home security cam. The app is really easy to use, and I love that you can talk through it or even use it with Alexa.The motion detection is spot on and customizable, so I‚Äôm not constantly getting alerts unless something real is happening. Setup took like five minutes, and the night vision is clear enough to see everything even in total darkness. Whether you‚Äôre using them for pets, kids, or peace of mind, these little guys pack a punch.",

      "reviewTitle": "Better than Ring... 2.4ghz setup.",
      "reviewDescription": "Works great. I had some Samsung cameras but last month the app they use was taken down because it's so old ..I think it was called SmartCam. I'm actually happy that's happened, because these cameras have way better picture quality and are faster and easier to use. And it's much better than Ring because there's no subscription unless you need cloud. Other than that everything is free all of the features are free and it's great!For people saying that they won't connect.. I had a problem with one of the cameras not connecting and it was simply because my routers uses both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz and these cameras only use 2.4. So you have to find a way to make sure your router is using the 2.4 when you set these up. I'm on a Nest system and you can't select between 2.4 or 5 so it took a couple of tries for it to register on the 2.4 frequency.",

      "reviewTitle": "Love this camera",
      "reviewDescription": "I did hours of research trying to find a budget friendly, quality camera, WITH NO SUBSCRIPTION. This camera is perfect! I use it to check in on my cats during the day since I leave at 4am and get home at 2pm. The night vision and day vision camera quality is surprisingly good (the camera doesn't zoom in but you can zoom in on your screen on the app). The app is easy to use as well and I haven't had any connectivity issues at all. My Wi-Fi is 5ghz but in the My Spectrum app it lets you switch it to 2.5ghz temporarily to set up the camera and it was super easy and worked well. I have been using the camera for a week now and I don't regret buying it (except I should have got a 2 pack). It has a privacy mode to turn off the camera when I am home which is nice. The cable is probably close to 8 feet long. The speaker is decent and it has a mini SD card slot. I like that it also has an option for both motion detection and person detection. I don't want notifications every time my cats run back and forth but I do want to know if there is someone in my house so I leave only the person detection on and it works 100% of the time (my mom goes over to visit them and it always sends notifications). I use it for security at night too with the alarm system you can set up. You can chose lights, siren, or both and you can set it for manual on or scheduled. Gives me an extra peace of mind on the nights I am home alone. 100% recommend this camera (save yourself the hours of research, I did it for you)!!!",

      "reviewDescription": "I switched from the tp-link kasa version of these cameras to the tapo ones..they are basically the same camera but the tapo ones have rstp and onvif protocols so you can view them on other apps and hook them up to a nvr etc.  ALSO, it has a couple of triggers (maybe just one) you can use in home assistant or ifttt.. AND, so far ive see use with google assistant/google home is limited to casting to chromecast (you can't control the camera with the assistant... just say to cast it to a tv).to use the tapo cameras you must use tHE tapo app.  you can add kasa cameras to the tapo app but NOT tapo cameras to the kasa app!!  the tapo app is almost the same as the kasa app.  The tapo cameras have a few other features that show in the tapo app.one downside is that the use a 9V adapter (not usb like the kasa cameras).. so you have to plan out how to hide the horrendous block (with the kasa ones i have usb outlets so its easier, and in hard to reach places i used usb light bulb sockets where I it converts a light socket into a usb charger and light bulb socket).. there are light bulb adapters that can give you a regular plug to plug the tapo camera into but then again the problem is the unsightly 9v block.Anyway, you take the good with the bad.  I guess for some reason these cameras need more juice to work.Ive got a 256 microsd card installed and it records 24/7.you can select activity zones, notifications, dectect baby crying, detect person etc etccrystal clear images, etc, etc..the app is fine, you can do everything with it that you need to.. no subscription needed (of course it always asks you during setup or there is an annoying icon next to the standard icons (pan/tlit, talk, alarm, etc) about 'tapocare' that i would rather not see if I never plan to pay for it.",

      "reviewDescription": "I've used several different smart watches over the last could of years and this one has been my favorite!Very light weight but a very sleek look. Does not look as cheap as some of the others I've used. There's a quick text reply which is handy. I haven't had any issues with the Bluetooth disconnecting like others watches. I like that it has the option to control the music but can also play the music from the watch. Another big thing that is very helpful is that it allows for lots of different app to receive notifications which other watches have only selected apps that it can receive notifications from. There are also a couple of games on the watch which is cool. The watch also monitors your sleep all day and not just at night. It also tracks your REM sleep. One down fall is that it is limited on watch faces that it offers.",

Able to turn on and off what notifications you want to receive. Love you can put face on screensaver, date. So many activity features including games. I highly recommend this watch.

      "reviewDescription": "I have been waiting to purchase a Samsung watch for quite awhile. However, prices were a little steep for me and I just couldn't budget it. I was leary about investing in a refurbished product, but am so glad that I did. The watch was in excellent condition, included a charger and shipping was fast. It has all of the features that I expected and seamlessly paired with my Android phone. The battery life lasts for about 2 days, I receive notifications and messages, and the quality is what I would expect from Samsung. I am very pleased with this purchase.",

I decided to get a new watch after the battery life of my old one would have it totally dead by the time I got home at night from work and wearing it approximately10-12 hours. I chose the galaxy watch 6 after reading some reviews online and I haven't been disappointed. Putting it on at 100% it's only down to 78% by the time I get home and my day consists of bike commuting to and from 8 miles along with walking around a factory floor for 8 hours (getting in around 20-30k in steps a day).The only thing weird for me is the band going inside when you fasten it rather than having it be on the outside.",

Night vision is great.2 way audio is nice though we don't use it. Tracking mostly works, though sometimes it'll rotate too far following someome then not be pointing where foot traffic is so it won't pick up motion and reorient itself. Not really a big deal, we aren't using this for 24/7 security, and if we mounted it on the wall instead of just putting it on the mantle, that wouldn't be a problem. App is also nice and all the configuration possibilities.",

The picture quality is clear, both during the day and at night, and the pan/tilt function lets me see the whole room easily. It‚Äôs quick and simple to set up through the app, and I love that I can check on my baby from anywhere.The motion detection works well and sends timely notifications, which is a huge plus for peace of mind. I also use it as a pet camera, and it‚Äôs been reliable for keeping an eye on my dog during the day.The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it five stars is the slight delay in loading the live view at times, but it‚Äôs not a huge issue. For the price, it‚Äôs a fantastic option with plenty of features that work smoothly. Highly recommend for parents or pet owners looking for a solid, budget-friendly camera!",

      "reviewTitle": "Flawed -  Better than other New Similar ONVIF/ RTSP IP Cameras",
      "reviewDescription": "I empathize with other reviewers who staate \"Tapo is Crappo\".  This new ONVIF/RTSP camera does not compare to the quality or functionality of the older PTZ cameras which had many options and were easy to view/manage in just about any IP Camera viewer app.For starters, there is no way you can use this camera without installing the Tapo app.  Why must you eat up your precious phone memory by installiing a NEW app for every piece of hardware you want to access remotely?  Well folks, that seems to be the Brave New World of proprietary products and self-centered corporations manufacturing the products we need.This camera has no setup where you can browse into the camera and change all the settings.Can you assign a static IP?  NOPE.Can you assign a custom camera port #?  NOPECan you assign preset positions?  NOPECan you use an http browser to connect to the camera, adjust settings, and view streaming video?  NOPE, NOPE, and NOPEThe mounting options are cheap.  In the past you were given a bracket that allowed you to adjust in the vertical and hoizontal planes.  This comes with the cheapest mounting bracket that would be possible for the human brain to conceive.Is horizontal adjustment possible?  NOPEIs vertical adjustment possible?  NOPEYou essentially stick this on any horizonal or surface the way you want it with no possibility to fine turn where the camera is pointing, via bracket.  You must \"hope\" that the PTZ movement of the camera is able to point it where you want to view.  If not, then you're either SOL or you must purchase a camera mounting bracket to give you the movements that should have been included as standard.Given all I say above,  you might be surprised to know that my opinion this camera is that it's not a bad camera and could be consideered better than average, considering the competition.Yes, many would consider this crappo and I'd have to include myself in that crowd, but if you consider the limitations vs. price, then this camera becomes a little less crappo because its' limations can be managed, especially when you consider that all the newer ONVIF/RTSP cameras that I've investigated, many at a MUCH higher price, has the same or worse defects than this camera.So, what were considering is what is the LEAST Crappy camera available?Believe or not, folks, this is probably the Least Crappy camera out there.Your system prerequisite if you want to use a non-Tapo view app to view/operat this camera is that you need to setup Port forwardings of 2020 (internal) and 554 (internal) to the IP Address for EACH C200 camera on your network.  Your router must be able to make IP Reservatons for DHCP for the IP of this camera.  If not, your IP will keep changing and you'll  continually lose remote access to this camera because setting a statis IP Address in camera setup is impossible.  But, if you can setup and IP Reservation on your router and can port forward for EACH camera to 2020 and 554 to each camera then you're likely okay with this camera.Once this is done, you might be able to view this camera on 3rd party IP Camera viewer app that support ONFIV/RTSP.Because TAPO is an Alexa skill, it's pretty easy to view this camera on any Alexa Echo SHOW device.  I setup a routine (Named for my cat) that will cause Alexa echo Show to view a fixed position stream of my camera.  You CANNOT move the camera using Alexa echo Show, but you can view the camera stream from where it's positioned right now.The Tapo cloud service is worthless, but if you add a 128gb micro SD card, then you can save detected motion to know what's happening when something moves in front of the camera to trigger recoding.  This works pretty well and gives you several minutes of recording time.  You cannot just click and download these clips, which is idiotic.  But, if you play the clip, then click \"Record\" you can record the playing clip, then download this recording.  It's convoluted, but better than removing the SD card, placing into PC, and copying over the clip(s).I definitely am not in LOVE with this camera, and if a REAL camera came along that would allow me to view on Alexa echo Show, browse into configure all aspects of the camera, and use on  any 3rd party remote view app, then I'd jump ship in a second and buy  THAT camera.But... given that ALL these type cameras SUCK, I woudl choose THIS camera because it sucks at  a LOWER price.  So, if your camera sucks, it's better to pay less for a sucky camera, if you can.Right now with the state of suck in IP Cameras, I'd recommend this camera as a BUY.  I don't like it much, but it's better than whatever else you might be able to buy at a reasonable price.Just like when voting for political candidates, sometimes you just have to go  with the one that sucks less out of a field of choices that all suck.Good Luck!!",

      "reviewTitle": "Amazing Watch! No longer worried about battery.",
      "reviewDescription": "My biggest concern when buying this watch was battery life. When it came initially, I put it on the charger for over an hour, but still had no sign of it charging. I was worried I got a defective watch or charger. I called support, and they were very kind, and said to let it charge for another hour, and then to call again if it still showed no sign. 2 HOURS later, I picked up my phone to call again, and right at that moment it turned on. It only showed 2% on the charge, but I was really happy to see it working. It took a while to reach a decent charge, about 50%, but then I took it off and got to work setting it up.Updates took a while, and even at one point it told me a few times it couldn't update for whatever reason. Past that, I've had no issue. After about an hour it had drained over 40%, and my concerns over battery life started to become true. I set the display to be the lowest it could be, I turned off location, and turned off the feature that automatically wakes up my watch screen. Still didn't help.BUT, once all the updates were done and day 2 came around, it had amazing battery life. I put it on the charger in the mornings when I shower and get ready for the day, about an hour, and it's fully charged after that. Even as of now, sitting here writing this review, about 36 hours since the last charge, I've just passed 40% battery.I will admit, I don't use a lot of apps. I bought this for the silent alarms and health monitoring, so lets talk about that. It easily detects when I start walking long distances, so I don't have to search for that function. The last two days it's been giving me reminders to start moving again after sitting for too long. I don't know where to turn it off (I've looked) but it's grown on me and I like it. This watch has better sleep tracking than my last, and its been very helpful to me. Vibrations are really strong, which I really like for silent notifications and alarms... I am a heavy sleeper though, so I have yet to wake up to any of these alarms without the sound. I really like the rotating bezel, but I'm afraid its been the culprit of accidently dismissing and snoozing alarms. It's not my only alarm source, but I kind of wish it was, to avoid waking roommates.It's been great at tracking heart rates, also something essential for me. I set it to track it all the time, because every 10 minutes would often miss the times I felt my heartrate skyrocket. It's had no impact on the battery, which I think is great.I have a rather small wrist, so maybe I should have gotten a smaller watch, but I do like the fit regardless. The band that comes with it makes it kind of uncomfortable, and I constantly have a weird gap because of how stiff the band is. It's gotten better the more I've worn it, but its still there after about a week, so I'm planning on buying another. It's really lightweight, haven't ever felt like it was too heavy. I got a simple black model, which I really appreciate since I work on concert venues quite often, and black attire is normal for me.All in all, I really love this watch, and would definitely recommend to anyone. If you plan on using the watch for the apps, I think another watch would be better for the batter life, but for my use it's been perfect.",

I cannot tell that is isn't brand new, and everything works well.  I have a Samsung phone, so using the Samsung Wear app and syncing to the watch was super easy.  Battery life is great - I'm at 75% after using it all day (no way am I going to be wanting to sleep with a watch on!).  The step count is accurate.  Setting what apps to alert was easy.  The display is nice and bright.  I haven't bothered with EKG or other body measurements - I care about step counts.  Along with that it purports to measure activity and calories expended - I have no way to know if they're accurate...  Anyway, bottom line - I'm very happy with this watch!",

Yesterday to today I got 26 hours with raise to wake and moderate use (no AOD, no power saving) and it was on 13% when I charged it again. Works great now! Very satisfied!",

Functionality is brilliant. Easy and efficient. Sounds and vibration for alarms are sufficient. Watch face options are good without having to make a total change. Screens are easy to change with the rotating bezel. Even if you don't have a Samsung phone, don't waste your money on knock-off \"smart\" watches. I had one; didn't even last a year.",

      "reviewDescription": "A lot of people forget that Beats and Monster used to be one and the same. These headphones have all the qualities of the original Beats headphones but with improvements. They‚Äôre not base heavy and the sound is smooth and balanced throughout. I have a pretty big head so I was surprised that these fit comfortably, though I had to max out the extension bit, they came fully charged at 100%. The buttons are decently sized and don‚Äôt make the cheap clicky noise that the newer Beats Studio Pros make. The ANC on these are also decent, functionality wise they block out a majority of the noise around you. Over all, these are a good pair of over ear headphones from a well known company. Monster has been making audio equipment far longer than Beats.",

      "reviewDescription": "I am very happy with my purchase.  This watch is very easy to use, it works for Android and iPhone. It goes well with all types of outfits and has features such as an alarm, heart rate monitor, sleep tracker, among many others. The best thing is its water resistance, I like that I can have it on at all times and not have to constantly check my phone. I can interact with calls and messages from some social networks, which I find great. The battery lasts for several days and I found the price to be quite good for this type of product. I would definitely buy it again for myself and as a gift.",

      "reviewTitle": "The interface and app are meh. The watch is great otherwise.",
      "reviewDescription": "Originally purchased this watch June 2023. Loved the watch and used it daily until it stopped turning on (Jan 2025). Bought a new one and they changed the interface entirely. They also now use a new app, which is a downgrade.The new interface is simply awful and not intuitive. I primarily use this watch to track steps and set 2-3min timers at the gym. Finding the timer was challenging, and now it disappears from the screen while in use unless you click on the icon again. I liked being able to look at the timer at all times while using it. Additionally, clicking the button while the screen is on now opens up a menu. Previously this turned the screen off. I don't like this change.I returned the 2nd watch due to the above changes. I kept 4 stars in my review because I still think it's an excellent quality watch. The battery lasted days, it tracked steps well, and could take a beating. It just no longer is suited to my primary needs.",

      "reviewDescription": "All in all a fantastic value. Comfortable for extended wear with decent sound quality and some handy convenience features.I bought these as a spare set of headphones just in case I needed some because they were so affordable. I didn't have high expectations for them but they ended up being my go-to pair of headphones while I save up for a more expensive pair.No noise-cancelling but I use them mostly at home on my computer so it's not been an issue for me, I take my others with noise cancelling on outings. They're very comfortable, with deeper than average cups for a budget set of headphones and actual padding over the speakers rather than just a sheet of colored mesh.Sound quality is good, I don't feel I'm robbed of anything while playing video games or listening to music. Though to get the best sound quality when gaming or watching movies I use the \"heavy base mode\" Makes things like footsteps/atmospheric soundscapes come through a lot brighter. The battery life is great, I can go a few days of long sessions before they need a charge. And any usb-c cord will do the job, so I can keep using them while plugged in.Seemless switching between bluetooth devices. If I get a phone call while I'm at my computer it switches to my phone instantly. Very handy for multitasking. Same thing if I switch to my phone to watch some things there.The mic quality is probably that of your average telephone receiver, nothing to brag about but perfectly functional.Like with most bluetooth connective devices the sound quality absolutely tanks if you try to use the built-in microphone while listening to music or other media. This is only really an issue if you're the type to multitask on your computer or your phone and you don't have another external mic to use for conference calls. It ceases to be a problem if you have another microphone hooked up to your computer, though. So if you do, just make sure you use that one instead.I give it a 9 out of 10",

      "reviewTitle": "Solid simple headphones",
      "reviewDescription": "Headphones are great for the price. Only issue I have is the left speaker fails after some time.These headphones are great if you are looking for simple pretty bare bones headphones to listen to music or watch videos. The sound quality is perfectly acceptable, it pairs well to devices, battery life is surprisingly long on a single charge, and they're comfortable. There isn't any ear pressure on the lobes or noticeable top of head pressure. There is a mic that can be used for calls or voice commands but quality isn't great. It will work fine though.  In terms of basic use case these headphones are a surprisingly superb deal.One particular characteristics are nice in my book is the start up and shut down is very fast. So you don't have to wait and/listen to a 3 or 4 second '\"startup sound,\" headphone name, heavy bass mode, wireless connected' every time. It's a simple \"hello, Bluetooth connected\" the moment you hold the power button. And shutting off is almost instant with a quick sound and done.The sole reason I'm docking a star is because out of 3 pairs I've consistently had the left side speaker fail on me. I'm not entirely sure why, but it's always after several months of use. I've taken apart the broken ones to see what's failing. I can instantly see the connection for the left speaker is a plug with the connection to the circuit board possibly prone to wear and tear. While the right side speaker is soldered directly to the circuit board. Unsure why this is but it's a simple design fix that could prevent any failing speaker.I'll reiterate that, aside from my annoying experiences, these are a very great deal for anyone who just wants simple good quality headphones.",

      "reviewDescription": "I wanted some thing small and simple which would give me good audio and an improved picture as compared to the front facing camera on my iPhone 15 Pro Max.I wanted it to be small for portability and capable of producing very good video on automatic settings, since I shoot my Vlogs very quickly and extemporaneously. I don‚Äôt have the inclination to check for perfect exposure, etc..This camera is smaller than you probably think it is. Perfectly pocketable.  Video on this is substantially better than video from the front facing camera on my phone. The audio from the built-in mics are better than the iPhones, meaning I don‚Äôt need to use a Lavalier or other microphone for really fantastic audio.I tried a budget action cam, But the picture was not appreciably better than Myphone and in some cases was worse. The microphone was garbage and it had no standard jack for audio. It had a proprietary port, so I returned it..I paid absolute full price for this, missing the Amazon sales unfortunately. Yet, I‚Äôm not returning this camera. It is my new vlog camera.I am very, very, very happy with a spectacular picture, quality and remarkable audio. The view from my mounting bracket is plenty wide.I have a Sony ZVE 10 for more serious filming, but this pocket guy does such a good job that it will become my workhorse.You‚Äôre going to get a better picture than an action cam and a microphone jack, but you may not need it. You‚Äôre not going to get a better picture than a Sony ZVE 10 or a 1000 or 2000 or $5000 DLSR or mirrorless camera.What you will get is video that is almost as good from a tiny little package that really impresses..Highly recommended",

I am not a vlogger or content creator; I needed to replace my 12 year old Canon and this takes very good pictures, better than my iPhone. The touch screen is helpful, and it's easy to use once you have settings where you want them. But there are a LOT of settings which I assume are helpful if you have very specific video needs, but for me I won't use most of them. One thing to note: if you want to use a cord to transfer to your computer (I put everything in Dropbox as my storage provider) you need a special HDMI cord to do so. My home computer has a memory card port which is what I did, but if you don't have that, you need that HDMI cord-- a regular cord won't work.",

      "reviewDescription": "The Sony ZV-1F is a dedicated vlog camera designed with content creators and vloggers in mind, offering a compact and feature-rich solution for creating high-quality video content. One of its standout features is its exceptional video quality, capable of recording in 4K resolution with vibrant colors and sharp details. This ensures that videos have a professional look suitable for various platforms.The ZV-1F is equipped with advanced autofocus technology, including Real-time Eye AF and Real-time Tracking, ensuring that subjects stay in focus reliably, even in dynamic shooting situations. This feature is crucial for vloggers who need dependable autofocus performance to capture clear and sharp footage.Audio performance is another strong point of the ZV-1F. It features a built-in directional 3-capsule microphone, which captures clear and immersive sound, minimizing background noise effectively. This setup is ideal for vloggers who prioritize excellent audio quality without the need for external microphones.For usability, the ZV-1F includes a vari-angle touchscreen LCD that flips out to the side and rotates fully, making it easy to frame shots and monitor recordings. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for vloggers who need to see themselves while recording or capture creative angles.To maximize your experience with the ZV-1F, I recommend investing in a light attachable for improved lighting in various shooting conditions. Additionally, consider purchasing extra batteries, ideally at least three, to ensure uninterrupted shooting during longer sessions.Despite its strengths, there are a few considerations with the ZV-1F. The battery life is average, which may require frequent recharging for extended shooting sessions. Additionally, while the camera excels in video recording, its performance in low-light conditions, especially in photography mode, may not match up to cameras with larger sensors. If you are a beauty content creator that has a setup I would say to go with another camera. If you‚Äôre coming from an older model phone this is a great upgrade. I‚Äôm still looking for the perfect camera for a beauty creator but upscale from this one the canon r50 is good‚Ä¶ check out my storefront to see the other cameras I‚Äôve tried out and what I suggest as a fixed camera for a beauty, fragrance, lifestyle creator.Overall, the Sony ZV-1F is an excellent choice for content creators and vloggers looking for a compact and feature-packed camera. Its superb video quality, reliable autofocus, excellent audio capabilities, and user-friendly design make it a standout option for creating professional-looking vlogs and video content.",

      "reviewDescription": "Since it‚Äôs a disposable camera, you have to get them developed at a pharmacy. There aren‚Äôt many pharmacies that do it anymore, but Walgreens does. It doesn‚Äôt have a vintage 1998 filter on it or anything, but the pictures still come out good, at least if you hold it still. It captures perfect memories that will last forever, as long as you get them developed. The lighting will be good whether you use the flash or not, it depends on where you are. It is meant for kids 12 or older. It is camera that has a green, yellow and white background on it. It has a bright, colorful background that brings you back to the late 90s or early 2000s. The flash works, but should be used in the appropriate conditions that it needs.",

      "reviewDescription": "If you forgot how to use these, there may be a bit of a learning curve to take great photos. However, I am shocked by how well most of my photos turned out! It‚Äôs a durable little camera that stays in my purse, ready for those ‚Äúcandid‚Äù moments that these cameras are famous for. Here are my tips to take great pics:1. Don‚Äôt wind the camera until you‚Äôre ready to take a photo. if you pre-wind, chances are you‚Äôll accidentally take a photo of the ground lol2. Hold the camera as steady as possible3. ALWAYS use the flash if indoors unless in direct sunlight. Basically you should use the flash 99% of the time. Even if you think you‚Äôre in ample light, use the flash4. This camera shines with outdoor pictures5. Do not get camera wet6. Send your film to an ACTUAL film lab if you can, your film will be much more taken care of at an actual lab that specializes in film and your scans/prints will be higher quality7. don‚Äôt think about it too much, just take the pic!",

      "reviewDescription": "I have at least 10 cameras , I use them for security and also I care for some feral cats , and just to see the other wild life under my deck in Brooklyn is amazing.  Skunks possums, raccoons very entertaining. I have one on my bird feeder no reason to buy a special feeder. Nice to see the dif birds.  Pointing at my decorations during holidays , thieves ir to admire lights. One on  Stoop for packages . Very easy to set up. I use the subscription service because I like to save alot of clips. But you can use a flash drive. Too .  If I‚Äôm away I can watch my cat and dog  see what  trouble they are into.  The pan camera took a bit for me to understand but it wasn‚Äôt fully loaded so I was missing the controls then loaded it was perfect. You can turn them off for privacy , the lithium batteries last a long time.  I bought another pan just the base for an existing inside blink so I can use as a pan if I‚Äôm away.  Highly recommend.  Also you can watch on phone app and share it with family members. Gives me peace of mind if one of my kids are stopping by that no one is in the house. I know they are safe . No solicitors when you know in advance it other unexpected guest.  My spotlight recently died I think it‚Äôs really the wire that you can‚Äôt replace from camera to light.  Which is only bummer. But when I changed batteries light shows as on but then an error only camera is working. So I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get another. I‚Äôll do a motion light that‚Äôs not connected.  When it worked it was very good.",

      "reviewTitle": "Very Good System & Price. Read My Detailed Review",
      "reviewDescription": "Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with the Blink camera system (and I‚Äôm not paying for the subscription). One of the reasons I decided to buy into this system was because I didn‚Äôt need a subscription for: 1) Live view option, which means, see the live video from the cameras any time I want via the app, from anywhere.  2) Save videos that were triggered by motion to a USB flash drive (memory stick) inside my house (not cloud only and not stored in the camera itself). Keep in mind, most of my comments here will be related to using the system without a subscription, but I‚Äôll comment on the differences where possible. Also, my comments may be a little more technical than most people would like, but for anyone interested, I‚Äôm being as detailed as possible :-) These comments are relevant as of Feb 2024 (the date I wrote this review).Viewing/Storing Your Videos: During the trial subscription period when I could view my motion-triggered saved videos in the cloud, I noticed the videos load/play quicker than if you‚Äôre accessing the videos stored on the USB flash drive in the Sync Module 2. Anyway, not a big deal, but it‚Äôs a difference. You need to provide a USB flash drive to plug in to the Sync Module, but those are very cheap these days and a 128GB drive will give you TONS of storage for videos since the file size of the videos is not very big. Also, with the cloud subscription there‚Äôs a thumbnail for each video saved, which can be helpful in finding important videos if you‚Äôre trying to find one with people in it, rather than a video triggered by a dog. Without a subscription, there‚Äôs no thumbnail on the saved videos which you view in your app, and it takes several seconds for them to load/play in your app, but it‚Äôs bearable. The nice thing is, if you don‚Äôt have a subscription, the videos save to your flash drive/memory stick in the Sync Module 2 immediately after the recording is finished. If you have a subscription, the videos only download to your Sync Module‚Äôs USB flash drive once per day, at night (as I understand it).Sync Module 2 & Wireless Signals to Wi-Fi & Cameras:  The Sync Module is required for the cameras, but you get one of those if you buy a package, like I did. I bought the bundle that included two Outdoor 4 cameras, one video doorbell and the Sync Module 2. It‚Äôs important to know the Sync Module and the cameras have TWO wireless signals. One that needs to connect to your home (or business) 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network and one that is only for use by the Sync Module and cameras and that signal is a ‚ÄòLow-Frequency Radio‚Äô (LFR) signal. It does not have 5GHz, but you don‚Äôt want that anyway because the 5GHz signal is weaker than 2.4GHz signal. The Sync Module is where you connect a USB flash drive (memory stick) to save your videos if you‚Äôre not paying for a subscription (and also for once-daily backups of your videos if you ARE paying for a subscription). PLACEMENT OF THE SYNC MODULE IS IMPORTANT! Remember, it has TWO signals. It needs to be placed in an area that has a good signal to your home/business Wi-Fi AND so that it also has a good signal to all your cameras (if you have them spread out in different areas around your home or outside your home). To give you some perspective, my house is a single-story ranch style house (around 1,700 sq ft) and I have a camera outside on each wall (each wall is brick). I was able to place the Sync Module and my Wi-Fi access point in the center of my house. Even in this central location, I have one camera (the video doorbell, about 38‚Äô away from sync module and Wi-Fi access point) that has only 2 to 3 bars (out of 4) for the Wi-Fi connection but usually 4 bars for the Sync Module connection. Long story short, make sure you place the sync module, your Wi-Fi access point and the cameras so they all connect to each other with as strong a signal as possible for best performance/reliability. It worked out well for my house, especially since I have flexibility on where I can place my sync module and home Wi-Fi access point and the technical knowledge and tools to move it wherever I needed it.Outdoor 4 Camera:  The image quality/exposure for these cameras is very good. The nighttime IR (infrared) view is very good also (it will appear like black and white footage). The coverage of the IR light when it‚Äôs dark is also very good and has better coverage than I would have expected. I have motion-triggered flood lights outside my house anyway, so if my lights are triggered, the camera may not use IR because it sees enough light (at that point it will record normal video in color just like it does during daylight). I bought 25 ft long third-party USB-C cords with a power supply to use as the power source for my Outdoor 4 cameras so I never have to replace batteries and so I can view live video from the cameras as much as I want and also have the infrared light set to High without impacting battery life, because there are no batteries to worry about :-). I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs different WITH a subscription, but the longest period you can record when the camera is triggered by motion is 60 seconds. For the video doorbell the max record time per motion trigger is 30 seconds, just so you know. Regarding the power, I drilled a hole in the bricks of my house (in the mortar actually) to feed power to my Outdoor 4 cameras. One camera is directly under a soffit, so there‚Äôs no danger of rain getting in there where the power cord connects (but the cord I bought is weather sealed anyway, not a normal USB-C cord). The other camera is mounted under a third-party security camera cover to keep the sun from beating down on it all summer (it‚Äôs on a south wall) and to keep rain off it, just in case‚Ä¶because again, I decided to power this one by a cord that plugs into the back of the camera instead of using the batteries). The included mount is very nice and flexible. If you mount an Outdoor 4 camera under a white security camera cover like I did, you may need to paint the underside of that cover with flat black paint because at night (in my case) the infrared light reflected off the underside of the cover/shield I‚Äôm using over my outdoor 4 camera and that made the video made difficult to see clearly. Daylight videos were unaffected, it was just at night in low light when the IR light was active for video recording that was a problem with that aftermarket cover I bought.Doorbell Camera:  For the video doorbell the max record time per motion trigger is 30 seconds. Why, I don‚Äôt know. Technical limitations? The Outdoor 4 cameras can record 60 seconds of motion triggered video. The wireless signals for the doorbell camera seem to be a little weaker than the outdoor 4 cameras. One big disappointment is that the video doorbell camera can NOT be powered by your existing doorbell power wire. My old Skybell brand video doorbell CAN be powered by the doorbell wires, so it‚Äôs a bummer that Blink can‚Äôt do the same. You can connect your existing doorbell wires to trigger your indoor doorbell, so that‚Äôs good‚Ä¶but like I said, you can‚Äôt use that wire to power the video doorbell. I confirmed this with Blink tech support. I hope they have a new version in the future that is able to be powered solely by the doorbell power wires, but for now, I have to keep batteries in it. The video doorbell device has a weaker infrared (IR) light than the Outdoor 4 cameras and lesser quality video than the Outdoor 4 cameras, but overall, it‚Äôs good (especially during daylight hours). The included mount is very nice and easy to install.Motion Triggering of Videos + Privacy:  The settings/customization for when motion triggers video recording is very good. You have the option to block out as much of the scene as you need to to prevent unwanted triggering of video recordings, such an area of the scene where tree limbs often blow around or something like that. For privacy, you have the option to block out 2 custom size areas in the scene you select for privacy reasons so that area in the video is grayed out. The selected privacy area does not trigger when motion happens in that privacy section and also, when other sections in the scene that you allow to be seen trigger video, the video that's recorded has a gray box in the privacy section (all you see is a gray box). That's pretty powerful and useful, if you need it. Regarding motion triggered video recording in general, I've noticed the cameras can accidentally trigger (record) when it's really misty/foggy outside. If there's a lot of mist in the air floating by the motion sensor, it can trigger a recording. Just something to keep in mind because you may need to adjust the motion sensitivity and/or 'disarm' the cameras for a while until the mist clears because you may be getting lots of unwanted/accidental recordings. I have mine adjusted to the point where the cameras almost never accidentally record unless it's very misty outside, which isn't too often where I am.Audio Quality:  The microphones on the Outdoor 4 and video doorbell camera pick up sound very well. I can clearly hear anyone speaking. The closer they are, the better of course, but it's very good. The speaker volume for the cameras is very good as well. It's plenty loud and if anyone is nearby when you activate the camera and start speaking, they'll hear it clearly :-)Blink App for Phone:  The app you can download on your phone for managing the cameras/sync module is very nice and has plenty of options to configure/customize the cameras (motion settings, video quality, audio settings, check status, etc). The app is where you view your videos, but of course if you‚Äôre storing videos on the flash drive connected to the sync module, you can remove that flash drive and plug it in to your computer to see the video files there or make copies of the files for long-term storage‚Ä¶but of course you can also use the app to save a video file to your phone if you want to keep a copy of share it with someone, like the cops :-). I wish they had an app for Windows so I could view the cameras live and see saved videos on the sync module‚Äôs flash drive right from my computer, but at this point there‚Äôs no PC app. I think there used to be one?...but if there was, there isn‚Äôt one now (Feb 2024).Price:  I compared the price of this system and what it can do with other systems like Ring, Nest and Skybell and at this time, the price difference is significant, in my opinion. The Blink system (and what it offers even without a subscription) is better than the other systems I checked out.",

Setup was super easy‚Äîno messy wires, just mount it and connect to the app. The video quality is clear, both day and night, and the motion detection does a good job of picking up activity.I love that the battery lasts up to two years, so I don‚Äôt have to worry about constantly recharging it. The Blink app is simple to use, and I get instant alerts whenever motion is detected. Plus, the two-way audio is a nice bonus‚ÄîI can talk to visitors (or tell delivery drivers where to leave packages).Only downside is that it doesn‚Äôt record continuously unless you subscribe to Blink‚Äôs plan, but for the price, it‚Äôs still a great deal.

      "reviewDescription": "I bought this on behalf of someone else to give as a gift to her daughter. I did take a good look at it before handing it over, and it was definitely stylish, and based on my experience with other smart watches of this caliber, unless I hear otherwise from her, I'm going to tell you that it works quite well! I'm only sorry I forgot to snap a photo of it before I handed it over. But I can tell you that it looks exactly as advertised.These economical and sporty smart watches are really quite wonderful, especially in terms of accurately tracking health and activity. The only ones I've had trouble with are the ones that are slightly more expensive. But you can trust this particular brand for its functionality, battery life and style based on my past experience. This particular version has a very large watch face which is quite welcome for many!If my friend runs into any problems with her watch, I will update this review, and if you see no updates, then you can rest assured all I have spoken here continues to be accurate.For now, I know she is tickled pink (which is the color of the watch band she bought for it as well)! It's very convenient to be able to change out the bands.",

      "reviewDescription": "I only have 1 complaint about this watch and that's the poor grammar on the weather report feature.  In reference to UV rays for the day, when it's cloudy (which it has been every day since I got this watch) it says \"Very Weaker\". I don't know maybe on sunny days it will say \"Very Sunny\" which will make sense? Other than that it is a great watch especially for the price. It connects to my Samsung Note 20 easily and setup & connection via Bluetooth wasn't the easiest but I was able to feel my way through it. I get notifications on the watch for messages etc within seconds of them hitting my phone. Watch stays connected as I walk away from my desk at work and through several walls and closed doors. Watch is also visually appealing. Also holds a great charge. I just wish it would charge on my charging station rather than with a magnetic wire with contacts. But those watches are several hundred dollars. I didn't want to spend that not knowing if I'd wear it regularly. Hopefully it will hold up for a few years. Also I leave the watch a smidgen loose while wearing it. On all of the Smart watches people complain of a rash. Well if it's strapped down and no air can circulate around the device and you don't occasionally disinfect it you're gonna have rashes. Staff lives on everyone's skin and MRSA lives in your nose, so you need to occasionally clean your devices.",

The sound is punchy, especially for hip-hop and EDM, though the mids and highs could be a bit clearer. Battery life is solid, around 8 hours per charge, but I wish the case had wireless charging. Also, no multi-device pairing, which is a little annoying. Overall, they‚Äôre a great choice if you want stylish, bass-heavy earbuds without breaking the bank.",

      "reviewDescription": "So I just received this product in the mail yesterday. Now I was overly excited to own my first beats. I was also happy to have bought them for a decent price. However these beats are not the best. In fact, they are basic. It fits well and connects properly but when you by Beats by Dre you think of loud booming bass. None of that. It has good sound and when I talk on the phone I can hear others and they can hear me. These earbuds to me sound too low and can‚Äôt really adjust to your liking. They came with no charger which is also a downfall. If I had to give compare sound quality let‚Äôs be honest my Tozos sound better. I‚Äôm a music person and definitely can tell the difference.",

      "reviewDescription": "The one thing I did not know about these before purchasing was that you can't change any sound settings on them, like increasing the bass volume.  What I did to fix this was go to the sound settings on my phone and do it there by using my equalizer.  There's also an option on my Android for a bass boost so I picked that and now the bass coming through my Beats sound perfect.  If you're like me and like to be able to tinker with the sound, know that you cannot do this with these headphones.  I know my Skullcandy Earbuds gave me this option, so I was expecting the same with these.  Overall, I like my Beat earbuds way more than the Skullcandy Mods that I have.  Sound is better. Earbuds fit tighter in my ear.  Earbuds and case are lighter and smaller and have a sleeker look.",

That's why I took one star away, but for $13 at the time of purchase, I didn't know and didn't find out until I used it with my phone.  Up until then, I used it with my laptops and desktops and controlled the volume with the computer instead of the headphones.Mic quality was always excellent and the ear muffs fit just fine over my ears and blocked the unwanted outside noise.Being a wired headset, the overall workmanship is excellent and still working.",

      "reviewDescription": "I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine \"has NO USB PORTS!!!\", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.",

      "reviewTitle": "Awesome notebook computer!",
      "reviewDescription": "I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13\" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13\" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27\" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27\" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!",

I was looking for something small, compact, and affordable for a family desktop computer for my younger two kids (9 &11) so they can learn how to navigate using a computer at home, while also being taught Internet safety somewhere I can keep a close eye on them. This was the prefect solution, because it's so small, I was able to set up their computer next to mine in my very tiny home office. As an added bonus, I can now do my work at my computer, while my kids play on theirs, and we get to spend time together that would normally be just working hours. (I'm self-employed, and spend an unfortunate amount of time cloistered away in my office.)Also, setup was super easy, because we all have various Apple devices. Added bonus is that I don't have to worry about the younger kids breaking it the way I would with a laptop or tablet (aka something portable with a screen), nor can they sneak it during a time when they're not supposed to be on screens.All in all, highly recommend. I might even be looking into one for my parents' to replace their old-as-dirt Windows 7 desktop computer!",

      "reviewDescription": "I'm leaving Windows for Mac, so this computer is completely new to me. Setup was both easy and difficult for me. The setup process utility worked quite well, but each step had a \"save for later\" option, so I assumed, based on my Windows experience that certain set up steps could left for later when I understood the Mac eco-system better. But some things really needed to be done as soon as possible. I advise that new users NOT skip any setup steps at setup time and then reverse the steps you don't think you need later when you have a better understanding of how things integrate.16 GB of ram is plenty for serious and advanced digital photography, simple video editing, and creative writing. However, the 256 GB of SSD is a little small for a home directory and the business of running the PC itself. If this computer works out for me, I will give this one to my wife whose usage is far more modest than mine, and I will buy one with a 512GB SSD.It's fast and responsive and very quiet. If you have any Linux experience, you will see a strong similarity in the base OS. It's the first Mac... anything that I can say is a good value for the money.I suspect I will be buying another one very soon.EDIT: My wife and I have decided to go ahead with a second Mac mini 4 purchase for her.  We feel that this would be better for her than a move to Linux due to the level of commercial acceptance of Macintosh OS.  The level of hand holding for the level of user that she is, will be far superior to that which is available with Linux.  The internal SSD will be more than adequate in size for the few 3rd party apps she will use.As for me, I don't think I do need a larger SSD for my usage.  It is possible with the Thunderbird 4 grade connection ports (they are compatible with USB C ports, but much faster), it is possible to move the home directory to a a Thunderbolt capable external SSD; leaving the internal SSD available for the business of running the computer.  I will install my NUMEROUS number of apps to the External drive where I have placed my home directory.We're going full Mac, even considering an iPhone move as well.",

My old desktop sounded like a jet engine, but this little guy is whisper-quiet. Plus, it takes up barely any space on my desk!",

      "reviewDescription": "Excellent phone for the price. I am mainly a Google Pixel user. However, I got this phone for my parent who mainly uses it for making phone calls. The call quality is on par with my Google Pixel phones. The phone packs useful features at an affordable price.  The phone has fingerprint sensor, face unlock in addition to basic pattern and pin unlock.The phone screen is large and pleasant to look at but not unwieldy.The bloat apps are minimal. Fortunately, Samsung allows you to uninstall majority of the apps this phone ships with. Therefore, I've uninstalled many of the unnecessary OEM apps. Before buying the phone, I went through a few reviews commenting on how laggy this phone is. However, I have not had any such lag issues.Buttons have reasonable tactile feel.It's plastic body feels fragile; however, it's functional. Fortunately, a $15 phone case addresses that problem.",

Then I bought this beautiful Samsung A16 5G at a really cheap price and I have to say, it's the best Samsung phone I have ever owned for the price. The quality and speed is definitely TOP NOTCH! You can open multiple apps and run with ease. It also has really good battery life too. It's all around a great phone and for the price it's your best option. Spend less and get a lot more.",

I had the screen replaced three times, and the phone still wouldn't work right, so I decided to move on.  I'm an Android user, and NOT techie at all, so I needed to stick with that system.  My son recommended this phone to me, and so far, I really like it.  It's easy to use, it feels good in my hand (size, shape, weight), and while the layout and some apps are different, I'm not having to relearn the entire phone.  The ONLY negative so far is using the 'swipe' texting feature.  My Moto gave me reasonable options.  This one comes up with words I'm not even sure ARE words, and they certainly don't make any sense in context.  Good phone, reasonable price.  Camera gives nice photos.",

I did acknowledge that T-Mobile is/has acquiring/acquired Mint, I do wish there is no further change to the existing plan, but increasing the data allowance would be awesome.I did travel to Canada and Germany this year, and I was able to roam in both countries by purchasing the mint roaming pass. This is rare for prepaid services I have to say.2022-07 update: hotspot also works under 5GHad to make some travels in the past month, I used the hotspot feature, and did a speed test. The hotspot speed tested on my laptop is the same as the one on the phone, which is 5G speed not capped at 4G/LTE or any lower speed. Gotta recommend this. Also I renewed again. Coverage still depends on T-Mobile.2021-12 update: eSIM is available!If you need help to convert to eSIM, navigate to the online portal and request it for free. Takes about 5 minutes.2020-10 update: T-Mobile turned on 5G in my area. I saw 5G on my Samsung Note 20, did a speed test, in the ball park of 200Mbps. Hence, when not congested,  performance is indeed rather nice. Latency is in mid 50 ms.2020 - 03 Update: I renewed for another 12 months. I don't see a reason to leave. Need more info? Scroll down!UPDATE:  IOS Wi-Fi calling worked. Please update your system to iOS11+.It has been 3 months, I renewed as annual plan. The past 3 months experiences were pleasant. If you need more details, keep scrolling down!I have been using different prepaid services for my personal phone since my business phone from the company handles most of my calls. Hence, I can risk my own device to try out all the possibilities and save a couple dollars.Hereby, let me break down into pros and cons:==============================================================================Pros:1. Big amount of data with hotspot tethering supported!Okay, for under $30 per month excluding the tax and fees, you can't find anything like this. If you purchase this on sale, yes, it will be 5GB (NOW WITH 8GB) per month for you for 3 months.2. Wi-Fi calling on Android actually works! (With supported phones)With Pixel XL and another T-Mobile Samsung phone, I was able to get Wi-Fi calling working, simply by registering online. Do make sure to check your phone compatibility. iPhone from my wife simply can't do it. Please bear that in mind. ( Worked with new iOS update! ) Make sure you update your E911 address on the website after the activation.3. Hassle free activation with no credit card needed for sign up!Well, if you are not sure if you will stick around with it, and worry about auto charge, during the sign up period, you can skip for adding credit card. And activation only requires the ACT CODE on the back of the card, takes about 1 minute to activate.4. Cute and elegant account management interface.My wife likes the sim card and the mascot design, you can't deny it. And the web management interface is WAYYYYYY better than some of those competitors. You can easily get the most you needed from it. But, how often do you need to log in anyway?5. Number good for banks and short-codesYes, your banks and short-code service will go through like a breeze.==================================================================================Now, lets talk about Cons:1. Data de-prioritizationThis thing is prepaid as well. So it is subject to throttling. That is generally known as de-prioritization. Since you are paying for the service with a discount. So you are not in the fast lane always.During the busy time in downtown Chicago, Seattle, and San Francisco, this card will speed lower.I saw some posts actually complain about the speed, but most of them didn't factor in this issue. The speed is not painfully slow unless you go to the stadium on a game day. I'd suggest on Game Day, just concentrate on the game and family rather than Instagram, makes you a gentleman. (Well, when you have to, since stuff won't load... Like 0.02 mbps for download...)But yes, off-busy time, I had same fast speed across boards as the speed from postpaid tmobile business plan.2. Customer serviceWell, the customer service waiting time over the phone is... long. So grab a cup of coffee when you call.3. Number poolWell, they must withdraw the number from a pool of prepaid, then depending on your luck. If the previous owner had the number signed up for some ghetto things, you will get spam calls and so.You folks might ask National Do Not Call List... Okay, here is a thing, it takes 30 days for the system to completely register your account.====================================================================================Overall, what do I think?I'll stick around for 3 months, at least. (I mean, I paid for this already, no refund at this point...) Also, if after 3 month, new customer if and only if gets the same $20 for 3 months, then yes.If it would be your primary phone and you need to do your next millionaire job with your service, then I guess no, go postpaid.If you are a person like me, who only uses data for none crazy things, like just social media, email, web browsing, or 9GAG on the go. You'd be fine. Streaming? Not so much...Good luck and have fun folks! Keep the SIM card, cuz it is cute!",

Real simple set up from an unlocked phone, if you don't have one either buy one (not so cheap option) or go through your current carrier to get your phone unlocked (the free option). Get a transfer code if you want to keep your number from your old carrier (i suggest you don't cancel your service til this is all done). Once it's successful transferred via the mint app, cancel your old service and your done. Love the interface of mint, way cheaper than other competitors despite it being on the T-mobile network (if T mobile is a big provider in your city/town, then the mints network is great and reliable)Happy with purchase.",

In an attempt to get the service activated, I have called their \"customer service help line\" only to find it is strictly automated AI with no real people to talk to, and it hangs up on me every time I input my zip code. I have been chatting with so-called \"live agents\" for nearly 3 hours now, and they have told me that I need to speak to Amazon about activating the phone. Then, they said they have no physical address wherein I might send a complaint to their CEO. Then, that they do not provide network services to my zip code area (<--- SHOULD BE NOTED IN ALL PUBLIC SALES MATERIAL!!!). Through Amazon, they have STOLEN MY HARD EARNED FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES (money), and they're making Amazon their scapegoat. I have screenshots of the entire \"conversation.\" Mint Mobile is an outright FRAUD company!!! I am going to go get new phone service through walmart/boost mobile, and am going to request a return/refund for the $45 spent on Mint Mobile GARBAGE. And if the phone is locked by Mint Mobile, and I am unable to activate service with a different carrier, I will be returning the entire order (phone, case, screen protectors and Mint Mobile card) for a full refund. I would strongly advise that Amazon cut all ties with Mint Mobile, as they are blaming Amazon for their own Incompetence and deceptive practices!!!",

I have yet to get it to work on a Galaxy S-21 Ultra 5G, or a TCL-40 XL 5G. In spite of the recommendations from Mint Mobile Text Support Reps. I'm sure this could be fixed by a technician at a physical store location, but where are they and who has time for that. Finally it's not like there aren't other options. Excluding that minor irritation the service has been awesome! No dropped calls, telemarketers, or excess throttling, mater of fact I haven't noticed any throttling the 3 months I have had Mint Mobile. Their application is more of an upsell platform than anything else. But there text tech support is responsive and tries their best to be helpful. So if you don't care about having a hot spot. Are willing to pay as you go quarterly at best, not monthly, Mint Mobile may be for you. Especially if you can pay by the year!",

      "reviewDescription": "I am a long time Samsung phone user and have had the S10  for a few years and I needed a phone with a larger screen since I am now 70 and have cataracts. I didn't want to spend a lot of money and the S series are quite pricey. I found the A05 in a mint green color that was new and only a little over $100. It has 128 gbof memory and a decent size screen. I had no problem setting it up and it is compatible with my provider which is T-Mobile. The phone itself takes a while to charge and it did not come with a charging block. Fortunately the one I had from the S10 worked. The battery life is not really great and will run down fairly quickly. I do not play games or read on it I just use it to check emails and pay bills and check on the news but I find it needs to be charged during the day. It also runs very slow at times and will tend to freeze. Overall I'm fairly happy with it but I'm missing the higher quality of the Samsung S series. If you were like me and just a casual phone user this would be fine but if you need something to work on and need higher speed I would not recommend this. For my needs it will suffice and I have ordered a case and protective screen cover for it which should arrive tomorrow. It was a great price and it is new so all in all it was a great bargain",

      "reviewDescription": "Pros:-Good for work/school-Resistance to scratches is good as long as you take care of it-Price (The current price, not the one i paid for)Cons:-Heat-Lack flexibility to do almost anything else-HEAT-Battery drains way too quickly (if you‚Äôre gonna be out and about for over an hour or two then just bring your charger)Can‚Äôt believe I bought this a year ago for $750+. First things first, if you‚Äôre looking for a budget gaming pc then this really isn‚Äôt it. Yes it can run old games and a few new ones, but it heats up a lot very quickly.(That and when it pauses/freezes, it lasts to 1-3 seconds)Secondly, it gets so hot that you might as well buy a laptop fan. The placement of the battery and fan is on the left side of the laptop, so it gets very hot. That includes the charger getting concerning hot as well. (really recommend getting a desk cooling fan/desk fan for those who like to sit on/at their bed/desk and work) Now it won‚Äôt probably kill you, but i don‚Äôt see it as a good idea to keep it charged in while you‚Äôre sleeping as I see the hot charger as a fire hazard if you‚Äôre not cooling it as well.The battery drains awfully quickly, and back then it wasn‚Äôt worth the price for this battery. If the laptop was around $500 a year ago, then I‚Äôd understand.I will say is that i had no problems when it came to school/work. Zoom classes are not a problem for this laptop.I want to say resistance is good, but i‚Äôm really careful when it comes to technology. Still, i have no scratches anywhere as I don‚Äôt a laptop case . So it‚Äôs good in the durability aspect.I would probably put this at three stars, but because I don‚Äôt really do so much on my laptop, I haven‚Äôt found any other cons.",

      "reviewDescription": "I recently purchased the Jumper 14-Inch Laptop with 12GB RAM, 512GB SSD, and the Celeron N4000 CPU, and I am very impressed with its performance! The laptop is lightweight and sleek, making it perfect for on-the-go use. The 14-inch Full HD (1920x1080) display is clear and vibrant, which is great for watching videos, browsing the web, or even doing some light work.The 12GB RAM ensures smooth multitasking, and with 512GB of SSD storage, I have plenty of space for all my files without worrying about slowing down over time. The Celeron N4000 CPU is surprisingly capable for everyday tasks such as web browsing, word processing, and watching media. It‚Äôs not the fastest for heavy gaming or intensive software, but for general use, it does the job perfectly.The 35.52WH battery life lasts for several hours, so I don‚Äôt need to constantly worry about recharging during the day. The dual speakers provide decent sound quality, which is a bonus for such an affordable laptop.Overall, for the price, this Jumper laptop offers fantastic value. It‚Äôs reliable, functional, and perfect for casual users or students. Highly recommend if you're looking for a budget-friendly yet efficient laptop for daily tasks!",

So far this laptop has worked great for my needs.  It's lightweight & thin, fits great in my backpack along with a few binders & books.After setup there's about 54gb of space left on the hard drive. If this becomes an issue I can always use a usb stick or external drive.There's 2 usb ports for a mouse & printer hookup // 1 mini hdmi connection & headphone jack that I use to hook up to a projector or tv with my own cables for audio & visual presentations and streaming tv.I have found that the battery lasts several hours when I am at the library typing up papers & can't find an available plug. It has Bluetooth & 5g wifi capabilities & performs just as well as any other expensive brand I have used. The webcam allows me to take the occasional video call.Laptop runs on windows 11 & after a few hours of updates, it's now running the latest version of software. Great value for this brand, excellent screen quality & sound.",

      "reviewTitle": "HP does not honor warranty",
      "reviewDescription": "I thought this was just the right PC for us. We don't need much, web browsing, some gaming, some MS Office work. Yesterday I saw that the laptop OS needed update so started it. Noticed it was taking some time so I just let it do its thing all day. Went to turn the laptop back on that evening, and got a flash from the monitor but nothing else. I knew it wasn't a power issue because the separate mouse (not included) was lit, indicating it was connected. Tried everything I could think of then went to HP website. HP tells me there's 15 days left on the warranty (\"whew!\") and gave me repair options (phone, chat, local warranty provider [Best Buy]). I chose to go to Best Buy. They worked on the laptop for about 25 minutes, and while I can't tell exactly what was done, I do know it was a series of keystrokes and a flash drive. Geek Squad hands the laptop back to me and tells me it's a hardware issue and not worth the cost of repair. I take the laptop back home and get in a chat with technical support. They have me do what appears to be the same steps Geek Squad did. Then they tell me I need an empty flash drive to reset/reinstall the BIOS. Now I'm not really that tech savvy, but I know enough to tell the technician that all the steps that they have had me do I already had done by Geek Squad, their authorized repair center. Tech tells me that without doing that last step with the empty flash drive they cannot determine that it is truly a hardware issue (really??!) and that they won't be able to give me a repair/replacement if I don't take that last step.Sorry, HP, but you cannot convince me that the cost of a replacement laptop is worth more than the bad taste in my mouth, and my withering review (not only on Amazon, but to anyone who asks) of your inability to honor your very limited warranty. I can't imagine why you wouldn't send a replacement of a low-end laptop just to keep positive goodwill towards your customers. And it's why I strongly suggest anyone reading this review to search for a different unit.",

      "reviewDescription": "It is decent for the price and it was supposed to be new.  The speed is no issue. The size and the screen is ok for the price point I chose. It was easy to set up. It runs on all the up to date programs. It does sometimes turn off for no reason or be hard to turn on, so much so that I be thinking it's going to die and not come back on (but this I think is an HP issue not the seller).  It came with a free year of Microsoft Suite which is a huge selling point. However, I have learned a lot over the last week ab buying products like this on Amazon.  So if I have to buy another laptop from Amazon.  I would buy the Amazon renewed premium since it has a 1yr warranty and comes with a check list of what was tested, battery life, etc.",

      "reviewDescription": "Update 12.20.24  Thank God for Amazon customer service! The computer worked until 12.6.24.  Then it shut down giving a BIOs error. Contacting the seller is useless. They will reply to messages with IT solutions, that if you are not tech savvy, probably won't be able to attempt. Luckily, I am tech savvy, but the computer still won't work. Seller is not good at customer service or truly wanting to replace/ repair the item. This is a very good value for the person who does not want to spend a lot of money on a new computer. It does everything as well as a new top dollar computer. Windows 11 works well. Like any new computer, you will need to update preferences and download from the cloud or transfer your files. It's a really simple set up. There were no compatibility issues with my printer, monitor or mouse.The only complaint that I have is the wireless keyboard and mouse that came with the unit. They are really cheap and it's probably better for you to use your existing keyboard and mouse or purchase new ones. For me neither the mouse nor the keyboard would stay connected.",

      "reviewDescription": "I will start off by saying I have no interest in $1000+ cell phones - to me they are disposable devices that get replaced every few years. That said, this is the perfect phone for my purposes. The coverage (carrier dependent), audio, display quality and speed are perfect for my needs. I use the this as - wait for it - a phone - as well for texting and taking some pictures, mapping directions, etc.This is my 4th or 5th Motorola phone, and I have always been happy with the value proposition. Even through my former carrier the Motorola phones have always had much less bloatware than, say Samsung (ugh) which loads up their phones with all kinds of nonsense. When you buy it unlocked it comes with even less bloatware, and you can delete or disable most of it.It is much faster than my old phone, which one would expect, with 8MB of RAM, and 128MB of internal storage. There are several things I like about this phone, a couple being that it still has a headphone jack, and also it will take a micro SD card for additional storage. Both of these features are found on very few phones these days. There are 2 features that are unique to Motorola on the phones I have had, including this one, that are REALLY convenient. You can open the camera app just by twisting your wrist, and you can turn on the flashlight by a chopping motion - no screen to wake up or app to start up - brilliant really.Also, the battery life (5000ma) is phenomenal. I can use it all day, leave it overnight, and it will still have plenty of charge the next day. I really only charge it every other day. I will note that I turn off as many background processes as I can, don't watch movies on the phone (really?), and in general use it as a tool, not a brain-sucking toy (editorial comment :-). If you want a well functioning device and don't want to spend huge dollars this phone may be right for you.",

It IS unlocked and has 128gb and 8gb of ram. It handles apps like a pro and it's camera is amazing for it to be a budget phone.Setup was easy, all I had to do was attach the cable to both phones and it automatically downloaded all of her apps. It charges fast and has an excellent battery life.It is fast and efficient. I am so happy I went with Motorola. I was going to buy her another Samsung A phone but it had less gb ram compared to this phone and was $20 higher!I highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a replacement. The screen and display are nice and bright and clear. The volume is excellent on it. Heck, I may even consider one of these when I upgrade from my S10+!",

      "reviewDescription": "I've had two Moto Power models.  I like the battery time, and the no frills style of phone.The one frills I liked on my previous model was two of the gestures - shake for flashlight, rotate for camera.  I upgraded the OS shortly after getting this phone and neither of those gestures work on this model.  Perhaps that will get fixed with a later update?Also a little disappointed with the lack of ringtones to replace the dopey one that is the default (it says \"hello moto\", so stupid).  But that is easy to fix so not a big issue.  That spurred me to browse a few and I quickly found one that I really like.The issues are all minor.  Bottom line is this is still the phone I like - good battery life, inexpensive, and functional.",

Despite the current price being 50‚Ä∞ than its original, I am 100% delighted with my purchase.I am now an enthusiastic Motorola fan based on the affordable price, quality, ease of setup and use, the storage capacity of the device, the capability of expanding the system with a sim card, long battery life and  useful features too numerous to state.Having had extensive use of most android and Apple phones priced between $500-$1600, I honestly found this model to be superior.There are  useful features for maintaining the life of the device and battery with multiple options. I use  the overcharge protection option to limit battery charge to 80% which keeps the battery healthy.There are many ways to personalize the phone to optimize your use. I have had no problems with syncing to my macbook air and pro.I highly recommend this moto g power 5g 2024.",

      "reviewDescription": "I needed to replace my Note 20 Ultra when the battery died and a replacement did not fit. Needed another phone immediately so this one was the only one that could be delivered the next day. I did not realize that this phone is NOTE 20 NOT A NOTE 20 ULTRA. It is much smaller and no expandable slot for SD memory card. But now I have a workable back up phone while I have a new battery replaced by tech at Batteries Plus (not taking DYI chances again). Happy with the purchase. Arrived on time and is in EXCELLENT condition. Glad I noticed what this phone is before I tried ordering a case for it.",

      "reviewDescription": "I ordered this for my grandmother as a replacement for her broken phone. Samsung is a trusted brand and the quality of this device lives up to that reputation. Although it's an older model, it still works well and is user friendly. Considering my grandmother has a habit of misplacing her phone, I'll say the cost of this phone was definitely worth it. Though it isn't a Samsung flagship device, it's still a very good phone. She can download her favorite games like solitaire and word puzzles. The camera isn't very good compared to Samsung's flagship devices but she can still take plenty of pictures of the grandkids and great- grandkids. Setup was easy and straightforward and we were able to quickly connect to wifi and Bluetooth devices. It does not have 5G connectivity but for a small child or older person, that isn't a necessity.  The phone measures 6.5 inches which is the exactly the same size as my Samsung Galaxy S20Fe which is pretty comfortable to use.",

      "reviewDescription": "WASTE OF MONEY!! Computer went completely black screened in 11 months. Warranty for 1 year.System was completely removed from laptop while doing class work, sent it to Hp and warranty was voided due to the seller modifying the laptop and adding 1TB when it‚Äôs only suppose to come with 256gb. Reached out to Amazon and they said I should receive call from seller which I never did. After seeing everyone else‚Äôs reviews I‚Äôm sure I won‚Äôt get anywhere with them and not willing to pay a $200 bs restocking fee! Hubby is a computer wiz luckily (I should‚Äôve let him look at it first but wanted to use my warranty).These computers are refurbished, all the parts are from HP EXCEPT for the 1TB Hard drive, which is made from Kingston. Did some research and a 1TB drive is only $60 (I would purchase a different brand than Kingston since it‚Äôs the cheapest, you get what you pay for).YouTube how to open and replace the hard drive (easy af)  and do it yourself. But this company seems to make sure these laptops only last but a year which is terrible for people using their last to buy the price of crap , trying to get through school/work etc. Smh. BUYER BEWAREI brought the Samsung 990 Evo Plus 1TB hard drive from Amazon for $70 and paid an extra $12 for a 2 year warranty .. just installed it and re-installed Windows 11 and EVERYTHING was backed up once I signed back in to Microsoft which makes me extremely happy!! DO NOT send your laptop back to this company, they will only sell it again with a weak/used hard drive for $400 to someone else‚Ä¶.It‚Äôs cheaper to fix it yourself. :)",

Somehow,  I had it anyway.  Contacting the seller following their instructions..  I ended up with ZERO office. It took three days of waiting for a response (one per day)  to finally get my lifetime of office.  Now,  all the nonsense being said, once I figure out how to, where to...  I love it.  It's so fast and has all the features and then some. The touchscreen works great, the brighness is adjustable,  so its at a confomfortable setting for me. The battery life hasn't come close to 5 hours yetüòï  Overall,  I'm impressed and happy with the purchase for the money.",

Love how it actually 'speaks' to tell you who is calling. Most of the instructions are pretty specific.  The only thing I would change is the ring tone.  There are approximately 7 tones to choose from but none of them actually sound like a phone to me.  Love that I can use this on speaker (doing dishes or dusting while chatting).  Price was prefect, great size, and no problem with reception. I set a different tone for the handset in my bedroom. So easy to read!",

      "reviewDescription": "We used a similar Panasonic phone set for more than 10 years, and the phones were easy to use, uncomplicated and worked well. However, it was time to replace them. We purchased this phone set expecting the same good quality and ease of use like the earlier purchase.  The new phones came with an instruction book that when opened made us laugh. Talk about a mountain of new features. We were overwhelmed and confused often. We didn't realize the complexity of today's communication environment.  To use each feature one must enter a code for it to work. We like the Block Call feature, but we really don't expect to need or want the majority of the other features.  We found that each phone in the new set has a problem with the speaker volume. When you answer a call the speaker's voice is barely audible even with the volume set to maximum. When we receive a call now we always have to use the speaker phone setting to hear the person. Even then, we experience some audio distortion that makes it difficult to clearly hear the speaker. The keys are large and light in the dark which is most helpful. If a lot of features are important to you, and your hearing is really good then this is the phone for you.",

Battery life is at 82% Upon opening. Phone is working great so far! Definitely worth the price! Would recommend this seller to anyone looking for an iPhone in good shape! Not sure on other colors but with the pink I would assume mostly females have owned them previously and most women I know keep their phones in cases so that probably contributes to the quality of the specific phone I ordered so keep in mind who would have owned the specific phone you order!",

I was very skeptical buying a phone online, as of course you could really get anything. But this phone is literally perfect. It took a couple days to get here, and it was perfectly unscathed. No scratches, no cracks, and it functions so perfectly. It‚Äôs as if we got a brand new iPhone. I definitely recommend this product. Also for reference we bought the best condition option. 100% worth it!",

I recieved just what I asked for, iPhone 13 with 256 GB storage in the color Pink. The phone came in great condition, no dents, scrapes or anything like that, just a few normal wear scratches on the screen, but very very small and minor. Cameras work fantastic, I have no issues with glitches and the provided charging cable worked 100%!The only few complaints I have are: I did pay for excellent and got a maximum capacity of 81% battery, I would expect a higher number for the condition I payed for; Also, under the 'what you'll get' list says that I should've gotten the SIM removal tool and I did NOT get one. And lastly, there are some areas that have what looks like dirt specks in small crevices, nothing too major and you can't really see it unless you're 10 inches or closer. Charging port also looks a bit dirty but it charged fine and fast with the cable provided.Final grading: 9.3/10, would buy again!Although there were a few let downs like Battery MC and missing the SIM tool, the value for the item in its condition is absolutely worth it.*** UPDATE ***It's been 10 days since I got it and Battery Health has already declinedNew rating: 7/10Still a good offer, but deffo not the best",

      "reviewDescription": "I bought an amazon renewed excellent condition iphone 13 from the seller bayshine trading. My expectations were low and was completely fine with having scratches on the phone and low battery health. But when I received my phone my expectations were beyond exceeded. My phone has no scratches anywhere and has 99% battery health! The phone did come a little 'dirty' on the edges but came off easily with an alcohol wipe. It takes a charge perfectly, camera works and looks good, sound quality is perfect. Everything I've tested so far works like new. Of course everyone will receive a different renewed phone but I think with the extreme discount a renewed phone gives (refurbished off bestbuy is 500, i paid 300 on amazon), as well as guaranteed 30 day refunds and returns, it is 100% worth it. I will be buying renewed iphones off amazon for all my future phones! :)",

      "reviewDescription": "These del 7050 renewed computers are a great bargain.They were originally sold as industrial and office machines and are about 6 years old.They were 5 to 10 times the price when they were new, real top of the line machines.But in the industry market 6 years is forever and they were replaced with newer better machines.They are still Very powerful computers for home use, better than my 3 yr old fancy gaming machine in all but graphics and not bad in graphics either.Of course the hard drives were destroyed when they were retired, and they never had internal WiFi, but the refurbisher has replaced the missing hard drives with a good large (1TB) SSD and included a small new USB WiFi module. They also come with a new USB keyboard and mouse.An unlisted bonus was a good CD / DVD RW drive. I don't use DVDs any more but it is good to have one in the house for legacy media.The refurbished unit was in spotless perfect like new condition.My wife's 15 year old Dell computer finally died a few days ago (pwr sup.) and at that age I felt it was not worth repairing. This replacement has twice the file space and several times the speed for 1/2 the price.I was able to salvage the old hard drive and clone it to a USB memory.Macrium Reflect is a great backup and transfer program, even the free version.I wiped the new machines drive and put in the clone and my wife has all of her files and programs and settings back!Happy Wife, Happy Life!Note on the USB WiFI Dongle:  It works quite well after it is installed and set up but it is tricky to install.The newly cloned operating system misrecognized it as a storage device rather than a network adapter.If you attempt to read this storage device it automatically installs the proper driver and then works and is recognized properly.",

      "reviewDescription": "I ended up getting mine from Blair Technology a few months because the site sent this to my old address. Still, I was hyped to see that the delivery time was supposed to be 2-3 days so, pretty quick. Unfortunately, it soon turned into a mess when I tried setting it up.For some reason, there wasn't a built-in spot for the monitor so, I needed a long gray cable. Once that was done, I started it up...only for it to crash. It did so again when I was trying to download Guild Wars 2. And for anybody not in the know, that easily takes up to an hour. Once it did, however, it was able to run for several hours.It also handled downloading World of Warcraft under 30 minutes. This was initially impressive since I had been playing a game with decades of content on an older computer. Unfortunately, it crashed 30 minutes later and RIGHT before I was done for the night.I later had hope in the morning. That was until it randomly existed out of the browser I was using. I then turned it off then off again to see a buffering blue wheel. So, I had to accept that it was cooked.In hindsight, I probably should've done more research rather than listening to somebody qho's quick to downplay any concerns. It ended up not mattering a month or so later when I learned this is the final year for Windows 10 so, I'd have to buy a better computer anyway.",

A wired keyboard and mouse are included, along with bluetooth and wifi USB devices. There are quite a few USB ports on both front and back panel. Don't worry about running out. Some of th eports are fussy about older devices, but you'll surely be able to find a port for each device you need.The unit I received had not been scrubbed for the prior owners security features and I had to send it back. Once the issue was described, the vendor happily provided an RMA number and shipping label for the return. Getting the new unit wasn't flawless. On the first attempt, they sent the unit to the right street address but in the wrong state.The computer gets a four because it is as advertised, but nothing surprisingly good.The vendor gets a four because they have a few quality control issues to work out, but they will leave you satisfied in the end.",

However, its limited RAM and storage make it less suitable for power users or heavy multitaskers. If you need a simple laptop for everyday use and don't mind relying on cloud storage, this could be a good pick‚Äîbut if you need better performance, consider upgrading to a model with more RAM and SSD storage.",

S mode limits the software you can use to those available in the Microsoft store. It wouldn't let me use LastPass or Dropbox. It came with Dropbox for S mode, but I couldn't get it to run.I removed S mode - once it's gone it can't be restored - and Dropbox and LastPass ran fine as did Chrome. It took several hours for Dropbox to sync my files, but it did so effectively. Thus, I have access to everything on my hard drive at home. I plugged in a tiny Samsung 256 GB flash drive (it costs $22 on Amazon) into a USB port and now I have far more storage than I'll ever need on this computer. The drive is so small that I'll leave it there for the life of the computer.All the programs I'll need when away from home run on this device. I wouldn't try to use it for gaming, but as a work away-from-home laptop for relatively simple tasks, it does the job at a very affordable price.",

      "reviewTitle": "With caller ID, call blocking works great",
      "reviewDescription": "I purchased the AT&T BL102-4 cordless phone set from the Amazon Warehouse (like-new used in original packaging)  when our family switched from a traditional landline setup to a VOIP landline with our local cable provider.  We previously had been using a cordless system from another brand with our phone company's service and the call quality was never good - often lots of crackle on the line, making callers hard to hear.  I wasn't sure if it was the phones, the service, or the cords, so I replaced all of them and started anew.The build quality of this AT&T phone system was a little less substantial than I expected, but the phones do their job and call quality is good.  The handsets and the base feel kind of cheap, but this is an under-one hundred dollar phone system so I guess that's to be expected.  It works well though, and the features are good.The only feature I miss is Bluetooth.  If this system had it  I could pair it with my cell phone, but other than that, it's not missing anything.----------------------------------‚û°Ô∏è  SETUP & USE:I put the batteries in the phones and charged them as I went to the included user manual to try and figure out how to set it up.  The manual is a bit overwhelming, but if you read it carefully and go step by step, you can figure it out.Some features on the phone duplicate those offered by my cable company, so I did need to figure out which ones to set up and which ones to leave off on the phone.  For example, my cable provider offers voicemail, and thus using the answering machine feature of this phone system isn't something that I do.Once I set up things like the number of rings before the calls were answered, I started adding numbers into my phone's contacts.  Doing this let these callers come right through, and helped with call blocking.  I set it up so that callers I didn't recognize would have to press the pound button on their phones to get through.  This eliminates robocalls, but real-live telemarketers can still get through.---------------------------------------‚û°Ô∏è CALL BLOCKING FEATURE:Call blocking only works if your phone service provider has caller-ID enabled for your account.It works like this...When a call comes through that you have not put on your call block list already, or that your provider has not filtered, you get an audio announcement of the number and associated caller name.  You can disable the audio announcement if desired.You can then decide if you want to answer or block the call.  If you wish to block it, you press the call block button on the handset which is in the lower right corner.  That stops the call from coming through and the ringing stops on the phone.Call blocking has been a life-changing feature for us.  The combination of our cable provider phone service and this phone has eliminated 98% of our telemarketing calls and all of the robocalls.  We no longer have to unplug our phones to get some sleep, and the calls we do get are nice and clear.------------------------------------------The top 3 reasons I purchased this phone system...1. I got a heck of a deal through the Amazon Warehouse during Prime Day (an additional 20% off the warehouse price), making it under seventy for me.2.  The call blocking feature to eliminate robocalls and telemarketers.3.  The ability to increase the volume easily on the handset, for my hard-of-hearing husband.----------------------------------------------- This phone system works with both traditional phone service providers and VOIP cable company phone services.  It comes with four handsets and has a built-in answering machine along with the call blocking feature that works with the caller ID provided by your phone service provider.The handsets are lightweight, have big numbers that are easy to see along with the LCD display.  The caller ID announce feature is a nice addition and most of the time it's easy to understand.üéØ I think this phone system is a good one for those who want to eliminate robocalls and telemarketing calls from their life.  I also think it's a good choice for those who are impaired visually or have hearing loss.===========================================",

      "reviewTitle": "I LUV this phone!!! If your issue is blocking numerous annoying spam callers‚Ä¶",
      "reviewDescription": "I give it 5 stars!!  (I don‚Äôt know what the ‚ÄúLock Feature‚Äù is, but just gave that feature 5 stars too).  I had a Panasonic cordless that was several years old and still worked perfectly, but it only allowed me to block 30 numbers at a time, which, with the increase in spam callers, caused me to have to constantly have to go into the block list and remove older numbers to make room for the more recent ones.  WELL‚Ä¶ this one lets you block 1000 numbers!!!  (Hopefully that will be enough for a while).  Also, my Panasonic cordless would announce ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got a call from‚Ä¶‚Äù and then state about the first 5 numbers, so I was still hearing it ring, tho I know from the area code not to pick it up.  With this AT&T cordless, if the spam callers hang up after my greeting starts playing, I never even hear it ring once nor announced.  And if the number is on my block list, it won‚Äôt ring thru either.  I check the phone‚Äôs caller list daily and if I see new un-blocked spam calls listed I can easily put them on the block list.  It is also much easier to block calls actively coming in or even afterwards than it was on my older Panasonic.  I only have to push a cpl of buttons to put a number on the block list with the AT&T phone, while with my Panasonic, I had to go to the Menu, scroll down to find block list, erase a number to make room for new number, go back to call list to see new spam number, edit it down to 10 digits (minus the ‚Äú1‚Äù), then save it.  It was a LOT of steps. So this AT&T phone makes it much simpler in way fewer steps to block numbers.  I no longer hear spam caller rings / announcements start in the early morning hours because most of them hang up w/o leaving a message. If they do leave a message - which I have not experienced yet since installing new phone about 4 days ago - I would be able to put them on the block list the same as if they hadn‚Äôt.  I have observed that spammers roll thru various exchanges to try to get to you by changing 1 digit in the number they are calling from at a time.  I am very diligent in checking every day for those numbers and block them immediately.  This is why the ability to block 1000 numbers is the MOST important new feature of this phone to me.  One thing that is different, which is not as good as the Panasonic, is setting Quiet Hours‚Ä¶ those hours between midnight and whatever time in the morning you do not want the phone to ring at all from anyone.  On the Panasonic, there is a setting to enter the specific hours once that you want to be Quiet and it observes those hours day in and day out; however, with the new AT&T phone, you have to set them each night.  It‚Äôs an easy setting, but still so easy to forget to do that before bed every night.  So that is the one deficiency of this phone, and I am surprised AT&T didn‚Äôt catch that in their development of it.  But so far, I have remembered to set it nightly.  Even if I forget, I still LUV this phone because it blocks spam callers so perfectly, and that is the main reason I bought it!!  So, if you have a problem with lots of spam callers and want to stop them in their tracks, this is the phone for you!!",

The speaker on the old one often made it difficult to understand someone when listening over the speaker, an important convenience for me.  This newer model seems to have worse sound quality.Unfortunately, there is no way to transfer the directory from the old phone to the new one but maybe all the phones are like that.  (I don't want to transfer hundreds of numbers from my cell phone over bluetooth - only the 40 numbers I have stored on the old phone.)In any case, I bought it for simplicity, i.e. it's basic features so I don't have to learn how to use yet another item that is intended to be a convenience.  It is simple to use and hopefully it will last as long as my old one did.  That one became unreliable when the little wire in the charging cradle dislodged and started moving around making a poor connection.",

First thing out of the box, it was physically different than the model shown on the amazon page; the base is completely different and the camera is just a hole on the top of the frame, not the flip-over shown in the description, and I have to tilt the PC WAY down for it to see me when I am using it. But these are minor issues...the big problem is the performance. Anytime MS Edge is running the CPU is 100% utilized, so EVERYTHING runs terribly slow. Websites take forever to load, and any other programs running are just plain slow. It's a good thing I'm retired, because if I tried to use this for work, I'd fail miserably. I wouldn't recommend this for student use either if they have to use EDGE, the processor just can't handle it.",

The only issue and it's a Lenovo issue is I wish they had a wireless mouse and keyboard instead of the wired version. I would recommend this desktop. I started with a Lenovo laptop and liked it and so far I like the desktop too. I have always been an HP person but I think the desktop and laptop have made me a Lenovo person from here on out.",

      "reviewDescription": "I bought this computer for my partner so that she could work from home and do her university work as well and overall she's very happy with this purchase. The computer itself is not that heavy so it can easily be moved around from room to room. The touch screen is very responsive so when pointing at something on the screen it's best not to point too close because you might click it by accident. The screen quality is very great too. It's sharp and crisp so if you want to watch videos, movies, or play games on it, the screen will not disappoint in terms of performance. The camera itself is really good too. Everything is clear and there is not stutter or lag even after hours of use. Overall, the performance of this machine is stellar. It does what it's supposed to and it's top quality as well. This was a solid purchase. I have no regrets.",

      "reviewDescription": "The landline phone system we had in our home worked fine however the problem was that we were constantly bombarded each day with Robo Calls  and all kinds advertising and junk spam phone call that were just never ending and very annoying to say the least.  I did quite a bit of research on Amazon on the new generation of phones that included anti spam technology and ultimately decided up this Panasonic phone system after going through all the product reviews.  I also liked the fact that it was made by Panasonic. The phone system I was replacing was also Panasonic and had served us well for many years so I have faith in the brand.  Setup and installation of the system was straight forward and easy enough and within 30 minutes I had the system up and running and set up.  I did have to read the instructions in order to set up my preferred preferences (voice message, ring volume, spam settings, etc) but I found the instructions very clear and easy to follow.  This phone allows  you to sync it with your cellular phones, which is a really nice option,  but I have no interest in this feature at the present time so I didn't bother with that, however I did read the instructions on how to do it and it didn't appear to be to complicated.  I may utilize the cell phone feature later.. I found the system to be visually attractive and of quality construction and the best part of all is that from the minute I activated the system the spam phone calls  immediately stopped.  It was like a miracle  We would receive no less that a dozen such annoying spam phone calls each day, sometimes two dozen. It's been 2 days now and we have not received even 1 such annoying call.  My wife and I are thrilled to say the least and if a spam call does slip through somehow all we have to do is simply press the \"Block\" call button and the phone and that number will never be able to call us again.  The system comes pre-programmed with an internal list of known spam callers and you can add your own numbers to that list if you need to simply by hitting the \"Block\" button.  Doesn't get any easier than that.  This is really a great system, I love it.  Its  spam blocking technology really works well and the amount of other features that the phone has is amazing.  If you're looking to replace your older phone system in order to avoid those annoying spam calls just order this system.... you will be very happy you did.",

      "reviewTitle": "Very nice phone with lots of features",
      "reviewDescription": "I bought this 5 handset phone to replace a similar, but very old, Panasonic 5 handset phone.  I was happy with the old phone, but some of the old handsets started to fail (no screen or keytone) and could not be remedied with new batteries or other troubleshooting steps.  So far, I'm very happy with this replacement.It was easy to install and setup.  Of course, the 99 page manual is a bit daunting, but it is actually comprehensive and understandable.  Keep it in a safe place since you may need to refer to it.Another reviewer mentioned they didn't like the wall mount.  It does stick out a bit more than my old phone, but it's fine.  I don't even notice the difference at this point.One initial oddity was that when an incoming call came in, I could hear a ring in the bedroom, but not elsewhere.  The Panasonic phones rang on the second ring.  Turns out that is a built in feature.  It's supposed to delay on the first ring in order to screen \"one ring\" calls.  It was an old conventional landline phone that rang on the first ring.  I turned off the first ring block so all phones now ring on the first ring.  It wasn't a big deal, just an oddity.I can't say for sure whether the 14,000 call block feature actually works.  But I don't get many robocalls anyway.  Some calls are identified by my provider as \"spam risk\", but I never answer those calls.  I may start adding them to the \"call block\" feature, although that may get tedious.One annoyance:  When listening to a recorded message on a handset (as opposed to the base unit), there is no \"erase\" option like on my old handsets.  When the message is playing you have to hit \"pause\" and then \"menu.\"  That makes no sense.  Fortunately, there is a key shortcut - *4 - you can hit to quickly erase the message.I have not used the cell-link feature.  I'm not sure I see a need to answer my cell using a handset.  However, I may try it out at a later time.Overall, I'm very happy with this Panasonic phone system and hope it lasts as long as my prior Panasonic phone.",

      "reviewDescription": "Arrived on time, and in perfect condition.  Easy to set up and use.  Bought for my 99 year old mom, who is blind in one eye, almost blind in the other eye.  It has a base & phone, with an add on phone & base.  You can add on more extra add on phones & bases but we didn‚Äôt need them.  We set up the main base & phone.  You need the main base for the add on to work.  The add on has large buttons, so I added bright colored paper, with an initial under the first button.  The second button, I used a different bright colored paper, with another initial.  I put in my number and my sisters, with the corresponding initial.  All she does is press the button with the correct initial of who she want to call.  She‚Äôs in a nursing home. This has kept her independent and can call either of us easily.  And she knows when we call her & who it is.  All she has to do is press the button that is light up.  This phone is awesome, helps her to call either one of us and also take calls from others.  She uses it every day.  Never an issue with the phone, voices are clear, easy to charge, easy to use, easy to hang up to end the call for a visually impaired person.  So happy I found this phone so mom can continue to be so independent.",

      "reviewTitle": "Purchased for Parent Who Recently Had a Stroke",
      "reviewDescription": "Update (3/17/24): Some items that I have noticed/learned since purchasing this phone for my mom:1. You may want to disable the Call Block button on the corded phone base. On a few occasions, my mom has pressed the Call Block button which has blocked my number after having called her. You can disable the Call Block function using the cordless phone.2. I've found that my mom will turn off the answering machine function because it has the red on/off button next to it. So you may need to check your parent's phone to make sure that they haven't turned off the function.3. The phone will ring even if the corded handset is off of the base unit. You just need to make sure that you press the 'hang up' button to answer a call in this scenario.I noticed that some have noted that they are having sound issues with their units. We haven't encountered this issue (yet) and have had the unit for just under 2 years.-------My mother recently had a stroke and we have found that this phone system has been helpful overall. Some pros and cons include:Pros:*The corded phone is best because there is no way that she will misplace the phone.*The phone has small slots where you can put a picture of a relative for easy phone calls. Instead of pictures, we put the names of individuals in each slot.*The corded phone is very loud (ringing) and for hearing.Cons:*The cordless phone can be confusing for her - too many buttons. The M1, M2, M3.... buttons (associated with stored numbers) are not helpful. A stroke victim with memory issues is not going to be able to tie M1 to the first number stored into memory on the corded phone.*The cordless phone sound quality is only okay.We ended up purchasing the accessory cordless phone that has less buttons and has slots for pictures (once again, we put in names into each slot). It's working well for her.Overall, I would say that the phone is worth purchasing. I initially purchased a different cordless phone with all of the bells/whistles. However, I quickly learned that it was too confusing for my mom. Believe me, you need to get a very simple phone to use. The corded phone is what my mom uses the most. (Note: You may want to purchase a longer cord for the handset/base unit - just so that your relative can sit comfortably to talk on the phone.)Good luck to anyone working with a relative who has had a stroke and ends up having difficulties using devices. It's definitely a learning experience for me. Hard to believe that my mom actively used an iPhone before her stroke and now finds that using a cell phone is too overwhelming.",

      "reviewDescription": "Smart Call Blocker use to work by inputting allowed numbers in, and blocking all numbers not on the list.  Was wonderful for my 97 yr old mother.  She would get 10-20 telemarketer calls a day and believe whatever they told her. It worked great until Dec 15, 2022.UPDATE.  As of December 15 the Smart Call Blocker function just stopped working and would not allow the approved numbers through.  Started treating all numbers as \"unknown\" and thus blocked ALL calls.  I could turn the function off and it would work as any other phone.  Could not find any help at all on this.  Called Customer Support and talked to a non-English speaking individual who did not seem to grasp the issue.  This is the disturbing part...  The customer service rep then called the phone, they did not explain why, which I initially thought fixed the issue.  I thought, how scary they can mess with the phone by a phone call.  Turns out that this person, remotely, disabled the entire Smart Call Blocker system on the phone.  Now I cannot block ANY number.  My paranoid mind tells me that the spam callers did not like this system and got Vtec to set the phone to block all calls forcing you to turn off the Blocker.  IMO I believe this was intentional, done remotely, and probably is the same for any other phone with a similar system.  BTW  I check to make sure no changes were made with caller ID for the telephone line vendor, also checked with other phones on the do not block list, all blocked.  Not any more though.  Everyone can now call and my poor 97 yr old mother has to deal with the $#@%^3rd time with tech and got the runaround on the smart call blocker.  I am convinced that they got slapped by telemarketers to change their block system. Tech support would just ignore my description of the problem and proudly announce that it‚Äôs fixed, you can now add callers to the blocked list, which is not how it worked before.  My mother has a hard time with the 5 button programmable tv remote, plus the telemarketers are always changing their numbers.",

I am using a headset through an rj9 adapter so I can use my Logitech gaming headset (much more comfortable than the standard call center style headset), but this phone does have a 2.5 mm port for headsets as well. I am only using one line at the moment, so line 2 stays lit up saying it's \"not in use or not connected\". Not really an issue; it doesn't distract me or anything. The caller id screen lights up so bright that I don't really mind that the keys are not back lit. I'll be buying a few more of these phones as backup in the near future.Update 2017About a year ago, I found the Headset Buddy Female RJ9/RJ22 to Male 2.5mm Headset Adapter (RJ9-PH25) and have been using my Logitech G430 Surround Sound Gaming Headset with Dolby 7.1 Technology headset. It actually works better than any setup I've had, and the range of sound gives me higher highs and lower lows than a previous setup that included a Jabra amplifier. I no longer use the amplifier and have better control over the volume of my calls (both microphone and speakers).Update 6/2017Yeah, still 5 stars. I have no complaints about this phone. When the power goes out, the screen doesn't work anymore, but the phone does still work. If you work from home, this is the setup I had that worked so well...AT&T ML17929 2-Line Corded Telephone, BlackLogitech G430 Surround Sound Gaming Headset with Dolby 7.1 Technology (don't get the USB version, although this comes with a USB adapter for computer use)Headset Buddy: Female RJ9/RJ22 to Male 2.5mm Headset Adapter (01-RJ9-PH25)VONOTO 3.5mm to RJ9 Audio Adapter Cable - 3.5mm audio female socket to RJ9 Modular Plug Adapter Cable for connecting your own Analog Headphone to chatWith this setup, you won't even need the amplifiers that some of those companies send, customers won't be asking you to repeat yourself and you won't have issues hearing them, and you'll be using a very comfortable headset that's far better than any of the call center headsets out there.",

      "reviewDescription": "Words don't even justify how amazing this product is. It doesn't matter if you want to use this as a home phone, or for your home office, or for your business, it is exactly what you need. First off, this phone just looks beautiful. Display is nice and it doesn't use batteries, rather it plugs into the wall. The speed dial function is very nice as well. It has a 2.5 millimeter headphone jack -- but I decided personally to go ahead and buy the Sennheiser OfficeRunner and use it with this product. Very nice combination. I work at home taking customer support calls, and this combination is absolutely amazing. The phone has adjustable sound levels, the caller history is very easy to use and super helpful, everything about this product is just perfect, and I am so happy with this purchase. Personally, I was having such a hard time trying to find a phone that would work for my  customer support related job, and I saw some videos on YouTube of this, and I just decided to take a gamble. Wow, did I hit the jackpot. To anyone on the fence, just get this product.There is literally only one con, and it's very minor. The handset itself is a bit cheep feeling, and when you actually talk through it, what you say kind of echoes into your ear for some reason, almost like some type of a feedback. But, considering I don't use the handset t all (as I use the OfficeRunner with this corded phone) -- it's not something I have to deal with.I would still recommend this product to literally anyone shopping for a corded phone, regardless of what you're going to use it for. This literally feels like a professional 500$ phone you'd see in retail stores, ext.Enjoy!",

      "reviewDescription": "Just bought this for my home office.  And i'm thrilled.  It took me a lot longer than it should have to finally find what I was looking for, both for a phone, and for phone service.I tried Magic Jack and Skype.  The issues I had with those are that it relies on your computer, and can be slow, crash or not sound right.  I needed something independent of my computer.  Cell phone service is fine, if you are willing to spend a lot of money up front, which I can't do.  I have heard people tell me that I sound far away, or was breaking up.  I needed something with more stability.  So I got Time Warner Digital Service, independent of my computer, after having a hard time trying to find a land line company.  Turns out, many went under, or simply stopped the service, because everything is digital today.I bought a dialer with headset, and loved the concept.  But the phone had many problems, including no dial tone, no ringer, and the inability to receive calls, or make them to automated systems.  Turns out it wasn't compatible with digital service. I got so annoyed, I did something I never do.  I found the best product I could afford, and payed extra for rush delivery.  I usually consider rush delivery a waste of money, but I really needed a phone, because my cell is malfunctioning, and if there's an emergency, I hate the idea of being so vulnerable, not having a phone.This phone is as clear as day, works with my digital service, has two lines for possible future growth, speakerphone and headset, large keys and volume control.  Now clients will have no trouble hearing me.  I love this phone so far.",

I can't relate to anyone who uses this more often... but I will say I'd feel for them.So this phone is great, I'll start with that, but it definitely has tons of flaws (but it's also really cheap, so expect them?) For one, it's very sensitive! Anything you glance at and it opens/closes the app. You could be in the middle of typing and gently touch the home button and you're there.Another thing is the speed. It is very laggy. I know it's 4G, so I don't expect it to be great.... but it's impossible to use sometimes. Patience is necessary.Good things about the phone are that it comes with a phone case. It's very easy to setup. It's perfect for business purposes. It works with Mint and I'm assuming others. It can take a few beatings. I have had 0 issues with it to date. And I love the smaller more mobile size of it. Highly recommend.",

      "reviewDescription": "Good value, is would be completely usable as a backup phone, or as a quick fix for if you need a phone that just works and comes with no bloatware, when it comes to size, it is a bit small when compared to any modern phone, though it is really easy to work on as it has a removable battery and easily accessible SIM card slots and an SD card slot to expand the storage, it came unlocked to my knowledge, though I haven‚Äôt tested it with a US sim yet, the screen could be better quality, but for what I paid, which I think was about $40 USD, it is good enough for what I need, though when you compare it to even a A51 from Samsung, you can see a difference, it will play YouTube decently well as long as it is playing at 480p or less, it can do 720p, though it struggles a lot. Overall a good budget phone.",

      "reviewTitle": "Good value, but watch for damage and who you buy from!",
      "reviewDescription": "Good value. I purchased this model: (HP 255 G10 Laptop, Ryzen 3 7330U, 15.6\", 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD with Windows 11 Pro) from the seller Chromebook Prosale via Amazon for $399 in December of 2024.I had to return the first one because it had a RAM error. Every other time I started it, the Caps Lock LED would blink (3 long and two short). According to the documentation, that meant a RAM issue. Might have just needed a cleaning or the RAM was installed improperly. (more on that later.) I'll never know because I didn't want to void the warranty. So I sent it back and the seller promptly sent a new one. No errors on that one. YAY!Booted it up and it indeed had no errors, recognized all hardware, and had Windows 11 Pro installed. All good. Pretty quick. WiFi has typical range. There are two USB ports, one HDMI port, and one 1/8\" audio jack. Battery holds a charge like a champ. No security port. However, I'm pretty satisfied with this laptop.Being satisfied, I then voided the warranty and opened the system to take a look. (I don't recommend this for the casual user because, though I'm not sure, I think it will void your warranty - if they find out that is!)Now the interesting part:TLDR: Be careful when buying from third-party sellers. You might save money, but you never know where the laptop has been or whose grubby paws were inside it!See attached image of the RAM. Note that only one stick is covered with a sticker. This leads me to believe that HP built this laptop with 8 GB of RAM (1 stick) originally. I can't prove it, but I think that the seller (or another intermediary) installed the 2nd stick of RAM to bring it up to 16 GB. Three clues led me to this deduction (which is guesswork): 1 - the lack of a sticker. That's weak sauce, and HP QA would probably not let that pass before leaving the manufacturer. 2. One of the panel's front corners was slightly lifted off two of the clips, as if the person who closed the panel (after installing the RAM) didn't finish the job properly. Made it easier for me to pop the panel though! 3. The first laptop I received had that RAM issue I mentioned. That would probably not pass QA at an HP manufacturing plant either. Standard procedure is to have a system booted at least three times.Am I happy with my assumption? No. But I'll deal with it after inspecting the RAM installed and comparing it with the first 8 GB stick. The laptop looks clean and I inspected Windows 11 as well for any \"weirdness\" or inappropriate programs.That said, would I purchase this again or recommend it. Only if a person's sole criteria for buying was price. Generally, I recommend buying laptops from the manufacturer directly.",

      "reviewDescription": "Bought this laptop for school and it was absolutely perfect, for a few weeks until it crashed and gave an error code. I tried to request a refund but it was 1 day past the 30 day window. I tried to file an asurian claim but was told since it was so new I had to deal with the manufacturers warranty. HP had to send a package to me to send it back so it took a few weeks before I finally got contacted by them. They informed me the laptop had been filled with cheap aftermarket parts voiding their warranty and recommended not buying off Amazon because of sketchy sellers like Chromebook Prosale. Had to wait for the computer to return and then contacted Amazon and explained the situation and they told me I had to go direct with the seller. They demanded I try a bunch of basic trouble shooting techniques despite HP already diagnosing it. Finally they agreed to a refund and issued a return tag to ship it. It arrived to them in 3 days but they refused to process a return for another 10 days claiming it was Amazon's policy and they have nothing to do with it.If you buy from them you are rolling the dice, because if it breaks I can assure you they will fight you every step of the way to get it returned or fixed.",
